insects,Organic,B0BDVCCKKT,Gabe Edmondson,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2024","It seems to be working great. I was trying to get some seedlings growing outdoors in the past and though things sprouted, one by one the leaves kept disappearing and everything i planted was gone. I couldn't tell what was happening at first, i thought it was some insects or mice eating the leaves. But after trying lots of other measures to protect the plants, i finally considered slugs as a possibility. Well, after sprinkling this stuff around some seedlings, none have disappeared so far, so i suppose it must have been slugs all along and so far this stuff seems to be doing what it needs to do.On an unrelated note, amazon was asking me to rate features of this and one of the features it asks about is ""comfort"" - not sure how to respond to that one, this is supposed to kill slugs and snails, i'm not using it as a pillow or anything, the comfortability of this product is irrelevant to me but i assume it does not generate much comfort for the things that eat it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

insects,Organic,B0BDVCCKKT,Mary,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2023","I have huge flower gardens and had major problems with snails.  In past years my pets were never attracted to snail bait until my last dog. A few years ago, I dusted the regular snail bait I had used for many years around my garden.  Fortunately I immediately caught my dog laying in the planter licking up the snail bait.  He was rushed to the vet and survived the ordeal (vet said Nugget was the first dog he had ever saved who consumed snail bait).  I stopped using any bait and my flowers were devoured by snails even though I would wear gloves and hand pick hundreds of snails from my plants almost daily.Then I found this wonderful product last year.  My snail population has been reduced dramatically.  I now use it when I first plant or when I see any snails on the plants or around the planters.  It takes only a small sprinkling to kill the snails.  It is easy to see the remains of the dead snails around the plants.  My dog is not attracted to this product and apparently it would not harm him even if he ate it.  Highly recommend!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

insects,Organic,B0BDVCCKKT,J L,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2021","I live in a rental property that was obviously neglected lawn and garden-wise for decades, and I have been trying to create a small garden here.  There were a lot of tiny white snails all over, and after a rainfall, you could not walk to the post box without crunching quite a few larger snails underfoot.  It was both distressing and disgusting to feel and hear the crunch underfoot.  So, I tried this product in May 2020, and it helped a lot.  This past Spring/Summer (2021) I noticed a bit of a snail comeback as t'were, so I plan to retreat the property.  I have been waiting for the price to go down under $10 before I pull the trigger again.I cannot guarantee you will have as good results as I have had, but if you apply this generously in infested areas, I think you will see a great improvement.  I made sure to toss some of the bits into my neighbour's grassy area, too, which I am sure helped a lot.  My greatest pest problem now is the grasshoppers.  If only I could rid my garden and yard of those voracious grasshoppers, I would be very content indeed.  They decimated many of my plants again this year, so next year I plan to take drastic measures.  I am not keen to use chemicals, but if that is what it will take to rid my home of grasshoppers, then I am going to take that step.  This year I planned to use organic NOLO Bait in late May, but the company who makes NOLO sold out completely so early last Spring that it was unbelievable, and they never made any more the rest of the season.  Looking back, I should not have waited.  I thought they would make more available, so I waited, but now I realise that was a huge mistake.  I was overrun with grasshoppers all Summer through October again this year.  I will look for NOLO next Spring, BUT if they sell out as fast again, I will use chemicals.  I cannot go through another season with no help against the grasshopper hordes.  Thank heavens this product at least helped me to end the snail and slug problem for the most part.  If you have a snail/slug problem, I suggest you try this product.  Sprinkle generously in infested areas on days that are dry with no rain in the forecast.  You will not see an overnight miracle, but give it 2-4 weeks, and I think your snail/slug problem will be greatly improved.Recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

The next morning I woke up, all 4 of my Hosta has been chewed and tear apart most of the stems at the bottom.  All of the slug baits I sprinkled on and around the Hosta were totally gone.  Something were eating the baits and probably tried to tear the stems to get in between the stems to get the rest of the baits inside the stems.

I put a few pellets in front of a slug by my front door one night and watched him go to TOWN on it like a fat kid with a chocolate cake! Did I say fat kid? okay... I meant me. Me with a chocolate cake. Mmmmm cake.What were we talking about again?RIGHT. SLUG KILLER.It almost works TOO good... I had a real problem after letting them go unchecked for about 12 years. I could go out after dark on any given night and there would be dozens on the siding, foundation and walkway. I did a combo of hand picking for several days (go out after dusk with rubber gloves and a ziplock bag and just collect all the slugs, seal em up and throw em in the trash) and then spread this stuff around their hidey holes where I know they sleep in the day (the crack between the walkway and the stairs and the stairs and hollow cement stoop, along flower bed edgers, the waterfall/pond, the woodpile, ect). I barely saw any slugs for several months after putting this out! I think I saw one lone slug on two occasions in the weeks to follow.But BEWARE. I messed with the ecosystem. The delicate balance of nature. And you know what happened? Mushrooms EXPLODED on my properrty. because slugs eat decaying matter and they LOVE a good mushroom feast. and I figured out that that's why I HAD so many slugs. Because apparently I have mushrooms out the wazoo! And fearful for my dogs health (I have the kind of mushrooms that sent Alice on her trippy ride to wonderland. My friend's dog died from eating one) I had now created a new chore. I had to walk around my half acre back yard and collect the bucket of mushrooms that sprouted overnight every single day.So as the slugs started to come back a little, I let them. I don't need to be slug free, I just don't want to worry about where I step when I run out to my car barefoot for my phone charger after dark, lest I get a slimy surprise underfoot!!

After using this for 4 days my dahlias were able to start growing without the fear of being eaten!  The only con is that when this product gets wet for 3 or more days in a row it starts to mold.  I'm assuming that in dryer temps this would not be a problem.The mold is no biggy for me - I just scrape up the moldy gunk, toss it and reapply.

I am not sure why this review has me rate the ""flavor"" but I am going to assume it means did the snails like it. These are NOT edible so...yeah.Pros:*These work as intended but do not put them inside the dirt they will mold. I took the advice from other reviews and I sprinkled them around the pots on inside them and it still worked since they went after these instead of my plants.Cons:*After you wet these, or get your surface wet and then sprinkle these on top, they will get real sticky and start to mold after a while. I am so grateful for other reviews that warned me beforehand and sprinkling them on the outside worked just as well.Conclusion: Yes, they eat this and seemed to prefer it and it stopped them from eating my plants but don't put them inside your plant pots. I wouldn't recommend them if you are going to put them on dirt in the ground cause it will cause mold to grow. Also if you place them down make sure it isn't going to rain. It just washes them away.

We had so much rain for a few days. I started to notice more and more fungus gnats on the soil and if the soil is moved more are flying around.I researched a solution to fungus gnats and came across mosquito dunks as a potential solution which includes Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis solids as one of the main ingredients. I have researched these online and some people said crushing them up into a powder and then applying them to the soil top would help get rid of the fungus gnats. Other people have followed the mosquito dunk instructions of letting the dunk soak in water for 24 hours then apply. I tried both methods and the fungus gnats are still present.I immediately seeked out advice at a nearby nursery. I go to this nursery for all my plant advice and help. They advised about fungus gnats and told me to pickup some Captain Jack's Dead Bug Brew which main ingredient is Spinosad. I immediately ordered and received it, applied it to all the plants that showed signs of fungus gnats. I then checked them the next day and a few days after. While the mosquito dunks may have worked for some people, it did not seem to be doing enough in the time frame I gave it. However the Captain Jack's Dead Bug Brew showed much less activity of fungus gnats the very next day, Captain Jacks Dead Bug Brew seems to be extremely effective. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a solution for fungus gnats or any other issue that the Captain Jacks Dead Bug Brew is stated to resolve.

I always thought it was sap but we brought in a tree professional who said he believed it was aphids. His solution was to treat the trunk with Safari two weeks ago. The dripping goo has been stopped and nary a bee was harmed in the process.There is no secret that Safari is toxic to bees. It's stated clearly in the documentation on the product. The key issue is when trees are treated. In Wilsonville Safari was applied when the trees were in full flower and full of bees which was negligence on the part of the contractor who applied the product. Had safari been applied earlier in the year when the trees were way ahead of flowering there would have been no bee story.

I've taken the certification test for pesticide application and you could really pass it without a good understanding of the way many pesticides work.This is a systemic insecticide which means it is absorbed by the plant and makes all parts of the plant toxic to anything feeding on it.  The claim on the label says this is a ""super-systemic"" which probably means that it not only is transported through the xylem but also the phloem (the transportation system for sugars - which means it will move into the nectar).It should be common sense to the applicator that this will kill every insect feeding on it.  Obviously, that's why it's the most effective insecticide against sucking insects like scale.  I've used it against beetles and scale with great results.

insects,Chimique,B007ROV0BU,thedarkmason,"Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2018","Firstly, this is labelled as an agricultural insecticide, and I didn't use it for that. I used it to kill two common household pests, and a seasonal one, and a less common one.Now that that's out of the way...it killed three of them (one of the common household pests, the less common one, and the seasonal one).The things to remember are:1. if you're using it by itself, in a water base (which by no means do you have to), it will not stop your misery instantaneously - you'll continue to see them for about a week, but they'll stop feeding before then.2. Only mix up as much as you plan on using: mixtures more than a day old will putrefy and there's no way to prevent this without killing your spores or adding something else.Another thing is that if you're like me, you'll probably have an allergic reaction to it if you're using it in and around places you sleep - not anything life-threatening, but very much like a cold.I was a fan. Pricy, but its cheaper than an extermination and unlike chemical insecticides, pests don't know better than to run away from mold spores.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
insects,Chimique,B007ROV0BU,8athome,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2019","I bought this product after reading reviews and blogs regarding the treatment of a dreaded indoor pest that no one likes to talk about. I had purchased a pesticide in liquid and powder form but since these bugs hide under wood trim and crevices it's impossible to make contact with all of them. Miss just one and before you know it, the population explodes again. Also, I'm just not comfortable spraying all that chemical and chemical powder in the house,  especially the bedrooms. With this product,  1 tablespoon mixed with 1 gallon of 70 degree water in a garden sprayer is enough to treat my entire house. Don't make the water too warm or it may kill the spores. I don't feel concerned about applying this to upholstered furniture,  even the sides of the mattresses and box springs. I also spray around the window, door trim, baseboards and a 2"" wide spray around the perimeter of the room and area rugs.  Initially, I treated once per week for 3 weeks. 4 days after the 1st treatment my daughter found a live adult in her room. I was not too concerned because it does take a few days after the insect comes in to contact with the fungal spore to die. 17 days later we have not seen any of these yucky pests, which tells me that those buggers that came in contact with the spores carried the infection back to the place they harbor. This product is said to remain active for 3 months,  however I will try to re-treat once a month as my husband travels for work and stays in hotels often. Not that he's ever seen them in any of the hotel rooms he stays in but it only takes one getting into his luggage to reintroduce them. We never did identify how we got these pests in our home. Possibly from the kids spending the night at a friend's house.  Seriously they are so common,  lots of people get them. I will update if my victory is short-lived but for now I'd say this product is the way to go.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

insects,Chimique,B007ROV0BU,nongeek,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2023","Again, I am making a change to my post. The initial 5-star review was based heavily on previous experience. Several years ago, there was an infestation that was apparently knocked back using this product. It so happens that these beasties can survive for years wrapped in plastic bags.After recently opening one with clothing packed long ago, there was a new infestation; so again, I ordered Botanigard from Amazon. It has taken two months of steady spraying, but finally, no sign for several weeks. I am hopeful.  I did increase the spray application to daily in any area that is frequented nightly by mammalian inhabitants. An unpleasant chore, but less so than having Bee-Bees in the house.But the 5-star review is still being downgraded by one star because there is no expiration date marked on the package, which makes me suspicious. Did it take so long to get positive results because the product was outdated? I'll never know.PREVIOUSLY: I am amending my previous post. Past purchases have been effective. The latest purchase did NOT have an expiration date. Nor does it seem to be particularly effective. Perhaps the latest package has expired. No way to know.Previous post: There are some reviews that discount this item as useless. NOT my experience. There is one dreaded pest whose name I will not utter, where I have found it is the ONLY product to actually bring this scourge to an end. Not immediately. It takes a week or two, and should be repeated monthly for at least a year. I have found these critters can easily do without food, not for months, but for YEARS. They even try to successfully to chew through plastic garbage bags.In my experience, there has been no deleterious effect on me or my pets. My husband did get a mild skin rash that was easily cured by an antifungal cream. I do wear a mask when applying by spray bottle, a teaspoon or so of the powder in about 1-1/2 cups of water. Spray around affected areas. I use it three or four days apart for about two weeks.Do realize this product is not rated to solve this problem, but it does.

Also, it is biologically safe for organic use.  It is a natural product all over the world but usually ineffective until contact.  That is one reason it is not as good for flying insects.

Did not eradicate but was good for control and managed a successful harvest with minimal impact. After further research i have learned that the fungus will not colonize in your soil spores only live for about 24 hrs. to increase its effectiveness add azadirachtin to the mix to slow the molting process of the insects. Look into a similar product called Met 52 which has the same mode of action but will colonize in your soil and greatly increases the effectiveness of the fungal spores to kill the insects..Good luck!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

However, if you use this sparingly (dilute it well), and spray the top side and bottom side of all Lantana bush leaves, then it will discourage (or kill entirely) the stupid bugs that eat my plants.  I have been using this concentrate for years with great success.  You might want to wear gloves when applying it, because the mixture is very toxic (kind of) and will stay on your skin for a long time and is hard to get off, when you are spraying plants.  So I always wear some cheap, thin, disposable clear hand covers when applying this stuff.  Hope this helps!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

insects,Organic,B00D8NQ26C,J. Davis,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2015","I wasted the whole growing season having false faith in this product that was recommended by the local nursery. From what I can tell on other reviews it seems people are just as pleased as can be.  I seem to be the only person alive that has fungus, disease, insects, mites, you name it, all over my veggies. If this product did just one of the many things it promises I would at least have one veggie left. But this product did nothing for my aphids, in fact, it seemed to fire them up to eat more. Powdery mildew was on one maybe two leaves of my cucumber when I sprayed as directed, it acted more like a plague distributor as now there is powdery mildew everywhere despite my di!igent temp checks and humidity monitoring and following application instructions to a t. Yes I got top and bottom of each leaf, I got stems, I got new growth, I got the soil, instead of gaining some kind of control, the fungus took over within a week and aside from letting my plant slowly get sucked dry I am tempted to burn it all down. Then I got aphids on my lettuce and they were literally covering the entire plant. I doused it with fertilome and there was nary a single death. It almost seemed they were raising their tiny glasses and cheering me. Next came spider mites on my greenbeans.  This product had no effect. None. This magical potion promises so much. And I have so much I need taken care of. Out of all the insects, diseases, funguses, and mites its supposed to eradicate, is it too much to ask to get just one thing?  Just one?  But no, for me the magic has worn off and all I am left with is putrid smelling worthlessness - although I may have lung cancer in my near future so there's that.  Oh ya and my millions upon millions of new disgusting life destroying scurg of the earth. And just so you know, I have a greenhouse that has a water drip system on a timer, the temperature is regulated morning and night, sterilized soil and vermiculite with monthly fertilization with granular fertilizer along with calcium and phosphates for the tomatoes all are provided via product instructions.  I wanted it to work. I really truly did. I gave it many chances to do something . . anything . . . entire growing season.  . . It simply does not work. Just doesn't.

The magical book provides a prior history lesson that twins Joe and Jemima, their clever friend and the hilarious talking Tonkinese cat, Max, will never forget. When the children and the beloved pet suddenly appear in eleventh century England, Charlie’s encyclopaedic knowledge is put to good use as they try to alter the course of history. They travel north with Harold’s army to witness the defeat of Harald Hardrada, invited by Harold’s unpopular brother Tostig as a consequence of a family feud. Max and Charlie prove to be invaluable! The children and Max become a part of the historic rush of the King’s army to the South Coast to deal with the other threat to the English Crown: William of Normandy. Sadly, a greater magic lurking in the flat lands of East Anglia determines the King’s destiny... plus his refusal to heed Charlie’s wisdom.

Prior to ordering these I had been using other brands of yellow sticky traps and, while they are very sticky and will catch some gnats, I always noticed more gnats floating around nearby.  I was having to cut them to the shape of the pot to get any effect.  The blue traps on the other hand catch almost 50 gnats for every one that lands on the yellow trap (see attached picture).

It does not kill on contact as the bottle states. The day after I spray it comes right back regardless if i use the recommended weak solution for PM or double the dose. i can spray my plants every other day and the PM will still come back usually within 2 to 3 days. This is also not systemic so if you're deep into flowering you can easily use over a gallon a plant spraying in all the nooks and crannies of your buds and leaves because the spray has to make contact with the PM itself. But again it doesnt matter because it simply does not work not as a preventative nor as an eliminator. I purchased a gallon for $100 a week ago. The price went up again after a week. A milk and water solution works just as good which is to say it doesnt. The only thing amazing about this product is how many people including myself jumped on the bandwagon to buy this crap after all the glowing reviews.

But sadly, less than 24 hours after putting out a few traps on non-flowering plants, I found a honey bee stuck to one. I did ask a question about bees on this forum and the manufacturer did not respond.Aside from the huge down-side of catching honey bees, these strips are very hard to set up because there is no way to handle them without touching the sticky stuff. The sticky side does not have even a small space of non-sticky to allow handling, and the protective paper is pretty hard to peel off so I ended up still getting the sticky stuff on me.I'll try for a few more days, but if another bee gets trapped I'm tossing them.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I decided the buy these ones because it appeared that there were more sticky sheets than the other options on Amazon.  But these were by far the worst.  The sticky sheets are only sticky on one side and paper on the other.  I'm concerned about them getting wet. Also, the paper is so thick that you actually have to fold them completely in half to get them to stay in the green holders.  When you fold them to stay in the green holders, it ends up looking like small post-it notes are stuck in your plants, not cute! The entire sticky side is covered with the adhesive, making it almost impossible for you to get the sticky sheet in the green holders without getting the adhesive all over your fingers and then making it impossible to stay in the green holder because it's already stuck to you!

Some I just used scissors and cut into smaller pieces and put on top of the soil or moss. Another tip for gnats is putting sand on top of the soil it will suffocate the gnats and they can't get out, or just letting your plants dry out and hopefully they die, the gnats love wet soil.

Also, I use tweezers to help hold the sticky traps.You can use anything to hold them up,  stick them on the pot or even on a plant.I also use systemic granules in the soil ( do not use in orchids) as this kills the hatchlings.

I'm not sure why they stopped selling it on here, so thought I would try this brand after reading the reviews. I live in Arizona and during the fall our dogs started coming in from the backyard with ticks on them. We have lived here for 3 years and never saw any before.I sprayed the large backyard with a higher solution mixture with a dial sprayer and garden hose. I immediately noticed the dogs weren't being found with any new ticks on them after spraying. It says to spray every 5 months I believe. But since this is a new problem, I am going to respray the backyard again in 2 months. Just in case any were missed.

insects,Chimique,B00ARKSABO,Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2022","I have been using this for some time and love it. I mix it with distilled water (maybe that's overkill, but I have hard water) and it never leaves stains or residues on all the various surfaces I have sprayed it on. The type of bottle this comes in is the best -- it makes it just so easy to measure out and pour the needed amount. I actually bought a bunch of these bottles to use with other chemicals as well, but they are not cheap. So great value to get it already in this bottle!BUT the listing here is just incorrect or something. I mean, it says 176 gallons from this 32 fl oz bottle -- the standard mixture rate is 1 fl oz makes 1 gallon; doing the math that is... 32 gallons from this 32 fl oz bottle. I guess they are showing you use the minimum mixture rate there, so be aware.I use this product as a general home defense product. Applied at the typical 1 fl oz to 1 gallon rate, spread around the foundation 2 feet in each direction where the foundation and grade meet. Also 2 ft around every doorway and window, spray the eaves and soffit too. Don't forget your garage doors as well, as insects love to get in there. I don't use it indoors, because I don't want to unless absolutely needed, but I am starting to experiment with using it in the garage, as that is a sort-of outdoors location and there is all kinds of random spots bugs love to collect.When applying this way, and comparing to neighbors, it seems very effective. Don't have issues with insects like wasps under the eaves for example. I apply at least once a month, but when there is a lot of insect activity I do it every other week (instructions say you could do it as often as every week, but every other week seems effective enough to me). I try to apply when there will be no rain in 24 hours in each direction (before and after application) to make sure it doesn't get washed off.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Several corners of the house had this issue. I could not sick on deck, since wasps would buzz me, sometimes aggressively for no reason...I was 30+ feet away from end of house where they seemed to buzz around every day. Warm days, cold mornings...so I got up early and sprayed one really bad corner, soffit, corner vinyl trim piece, got all the cracks and crevices...while the bees slept in out of the cold. I was nervous spraying, expected a swarm. I would spray a second and run far away and observe. Braver and braver I sprayed more. That was one corner on day 1. It stayed cold all day, no wasps. The next day it warmed up, but I was never outside n deck. The day after I walked out and saw several wasps dead on the deck. Hooray! I sprayed again since I did see a few random wasps flying around. Then a day or two later I sprayed all the soffit areas, vinyl trim corners, gaps, holes, crevices, around crawl space to floor wall, in crawl space vents, any place I felt bugs or bees could intrude or live. Success. I occasionally see a yellow jacket or wasp, but no swarms on house or attacks on the deck. A European hornet buzzes by once in a while, but they nest out on the woods. So much happier now without wasps everywhere. Well worth the money and 1 gallon sprayer to treat this house. Also no more crickets in crawl space or inside house. Crickets use to be inside once or twice every week. Happy camper here :-)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

But beyond that, I have kids AND a cat. How could I ensure I wasn’t poisoning them?It took me a full month after ordering this product to work up the courage to try it, and it was SUPER easy to use. I ordered a sprayer too, and then you just mix however much the package says with one gallon of water in the sprayer.I sprayed all around the perimeter house, then I sprayed the perimeters of all the rooms inside. My house is 3,000+ sq ft, and one gallon was more than enough to spray both inside and outside.My kids and cat were completely unaffected. My cat even followed me around for most of the interior spraying, despite my best efforts to dissuade her (I should’ve locked her in a room; I’ll do that next time.) For point of reference, my cat is very small. Maybe 5 lbs? Which is why I’m writing this entire review... I was so scared it would effect her, and I had researched like crazy before working up the courage to actually spray LOL. If you follow the guidelines on the back of the package for ratio mixing, your fur baby will be ok. ❤️Normally, when the bug sprayer would come, we would see more bugs come out of hiding the day immediately after, then they would be gone. Not with this stuff. My ant infestation (pictured) was immediately gone. I’ve seen no spiders. I’m crazy impressed!

The spiders and other nasties that crawl out of there are shocking and dangerous.This products toxicity is low for humans and animals, yet yields a high degree of toxicity for flying insects, arachnids and other creepy crawlies.One broad application on my eaves and ground perimeters, topped off with spraying the tops and sides of all bushes and trees, keeps our family and animals bug free for months and months.It seems to keep killing week after week because I find new carcasses months after applying.The amount of airborne insect traffic throughout the day into the evening has decreased dramatically. I believe that to be the result of spraying the tops and sides of all bushes and trees.I have recommended this product to my neighbors for them to try. Its effective for long term pest management and allows us to spend more time outside.This is not a ""bang your dead"" bug spray. Its systemic and persistent. It will ultimately kill the bugs in large numbers over long periods of time. That reduces the overall population and keeps them from reproducing in annoying numbers.Best wishes and happy bug killing.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

insects,Chimique,B00ARKSABO,Neil Massey,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2013","Lowes doesn't carry this product. Home Depot does, but only online. Home Depot was also asking twice the price I found on Amazon, and with Prime, shipping was free, so the cost was even lower! One other significant difference between this brand and others is that this has 7.9% Bifenthrin, whereas other brands only have slightly over 2%. This is a concentrate, so it does pour out quite thick, but it easily dilutes in water in the sprayer. It's best if you mix the solution before you begin spraying. Just shake your bottle sprayer and you should be good to go.As for how the product worked, I found it to be excellent. I got this specifically to kill the Spittle bugs that were killing my lawn. After I figured out how many sq. ft. my lawn was, I only needed to mix 1 oz. per 1000 sq. ft. in a hose sprayer filled with water,  and I was good to go. It took me two days to do my lawn - I had to blow the leaves off first - completing the front and sides on the first day and the back yard the second day. I covered over 1/2 acre and still have plenty left over for a 2nd application.After spraying my front yard and sides, I went out the next morning and saw plenty of dead Spittle bugs lying in the grass, road and on my driveway. The second day went similarly in the back yard. Now, I'm starting to see my grass come back from the brink of dying due to a very wet Spring and Summer when Spittle bugs are very actively laying eggs and chomping my centipede and zoyzia grasses like there's no tomorrow!

I have previously used Martin's 10% concentration which had no unpleasant odors and whatever odor it did have was not lasting. I had no reason to think the 13.3% concentration would be any different but it is like night and day. Cannot store in house after opening and diluting 1:22 to reduce to .5% permethrin suitable for clothing. The label does say ""contains petroleum distillates"" and that must be the source of the smell. Even if I had a garage or shed to store this in it would not be worth keeping. It smells like gasoline.Doing further research I'm unable to find any concentrated permethrin product that does not contain petroleum distillates.

insects,Organic,B07XF83PXK,Sara,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2020","I used this product to combat both aphids and fungus gnats (I also had springtails but they’re less of a problem) in my indoor plants. I was obviously having quite a time with these pests and just wanted something that would take them out without me having to do something every couple of hours to cut their populations but I also wanted it to be safe around me and my dog. After a lot of research, I settled on DA. I’ve had to “reapply” on certain plants because once watered, the DA does drift into the soil so there’s not always enough to combat insects around the rim of the pot, etc. However, to my understanding, it will keep working as long as it’s dry. Anyway, I’ve seen a significant decrease in fungus gnats, I’ve noticed less aphids and even springtails (even though I wasn’t focused on them). It has even managed to kill the aphids affecting one of my succulent props that I thought would die after seeing aphids literally coming out of it, however succulent is doing great and putting out new growth and doesn’t seem to have any aphids affecting it. Definitely would recommend. Just make sure not to inhale the dust",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

insects,Chimique,B00ARKSBEA,LabLover,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2017","I was very nervous about using this in my backyard as I have dogs who like to eat grass and generally anything they can. Things came to a head when I started seeing brown widows on our chimney and in our shed and that was the end of it. We looked into having a professional come out, but the price was ridiculous and it seemed like something that we could do. The stuff you can buy at Home Depot doesn't do much of anything so I knew it had to be a stronger product, and after days of research I landed on this product.  The only other things you need are some gloves and a hand held sprayer. The instructions are very clear and give you the mix amounts for different insects you want to kill. We have a 10,000 s.f. lot and it only took two oz of concentrate to produce 2 gallons of spray and I was able to get the entire lot. We were going on vacation so the dogs were already at the kennel so I didn't have to worry about them getting into it, as it is supposed to be safe to large animals and people once dry,  however it remains deadly to small insects at that point though. When I was spraying it the spiders immediately came out of their hiding spots trying to survive but within about 30 minutes when I came back they were all dead. It was a little disturbing to see how many spiders there really were in our backyard but I feel much better now knowing that they are dead. I will be re-applying every month to keep them away. I would highly recommend this and it was very easy to use.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Mix with an IGR and its very effective. The negative reviews here are comical because they don't understand what they are buying. This is not a contact kill. It cripples their nervous systems and takes anywhere from minutes to hours to kill. It is a residual killer that lasts a long time. Also, beware the amount you are mixing because it is really easy to contaminate your house if spraying indoors.

The instructions recommends .01 up to .05oz per gallon of water to kill most insects.(measurements are on the bottle).  The 1oz per gallon is recommended for use when trying to kill a select group of insects listed on the label (More like a soil treatment). There is also a section that covers mixing for indoor use.

insects,Chimique,B00ARKSBEA,Sue P,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2016","I have to say I was skeptical but decided to buy this after seeing the Rutgers University school of agriculture site that listed this active ingredient as one that is sometimes effective against the dreaded BMSB's or STINK BUGS!!!!!!! I hate those little critters and was rapidly losing the batter against them when I decided I had reached the end of my rope, constantly falling over vacuum sweepers left out to suck up the creepy things and constantly on drapery watch, where they tend to nestle. I received the bottle and immediately sent my hubby to the garage for the sprayer. I mixed up my first batch, 1/3 oz to 1 gallon of water and sprayed all of my window screens from the inside, spraying out, sprayed around all my window and door openings and sills both inside and out and even in the vents of my window ACs, where I know they're getting in. I cannot tell you how happy I am with the results. As early as day two, the number of the ugly bastards was hugely diminished on the screens to just a few here and there and the number I would see on the ceiling, that always seem to just magically appear also was greatly reduced. On day three,I  found dozens of dead critters on the floor in front of doors and windows, both inside and out. Went outside to look at the siding of the house that was polluted with them previously and was astonished to see a war zone like setting of dead stink bugs all over the deck, on the tables and chairs and even a few on the railings. I hope this last was a sign of the last few soldiers struggling to make it to safety before they died, only to expire - fingers crossed * hopefully creepily - before they too kicked the bucket! I finally today reinstalled my freshly laundered and dry cleaned draperies and have yet to see a one today. My first bug free day, DAY 5. It is not a contact kill for these insidious monsters but it sure does the job. Just make sure you handle it properly and carefully in good ventilation and keep free of food prep and eating areas.

I mixed up the concentrate with a gallon of water and sprayed the corners of the basement, up to the ceiling.  I sprayed 3 feet from the floor up the walls.  I sprayed between the floor joists of the basement ceiling.  Two hours later I came back and found most of the spiders had stopped moving in their webs.

insects,Chimique,B00ARKSBEA,Roy,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2021","Yeah, it kills bugs if you spray them directly with it.  And it will eventually kill those bugs that cross over a recently sprayed area.  But not many will cross into an area where this has recently been applied because they can detect it and avoid it.  And unless a bug comes into and rolls around on a treated area, Bifenthrin has no effect.  We can't sense it, but they can. I watched a cockroach one evening do a little zig-zag tap dance around a treated area, seemingly giving me the bug finger the whole route. Very demoralizing. Not all will avoid it, just like not all humans avoid unhealthy food, but more than I am willing to put up with will.  Yes, like junk food, eventually it builds up to the point it does kill them, but by then they've reared a few equally flippant generations of pests.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

insects,Organic,B001ACRZFA,Mary,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2023","I have huge flower gardens and had major problems with snails.  In past years my pets were never attracted to snail bait until my last dog. A few years ago, I dusted the regular snail bait I had used for many years around my garden.  Fortunately I immediately caught my dog laying in the planter licking up the snail bait.  He was rushed to the vet and survived the ordeal (vet said Nugget was the first dog he had ever saved who consumed snail bait).  I stopped using any bait and my flowers were devoured by snails even though I would wear gloves and hand pick hundreds of snails from my plants almost daily.Then I found this wonderful product last year.  My snail population has been reduced dramatically.  I now use it when I first plant or when I see any snails on the plants or around the planters.  It takes only a small sprinkling to kill the snails.  It is easy to see the remains of the dead snails around the plants.  My dog is not attracted to this product and apparently it would not harm him even if he ate it.  Highly recommend!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

insects,Organic,B001ACRZFA,J L,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2021","I live in a rental property that was obviously neglected lawn and garden-wise for decades, and I have been trying to create a small garden here.  There were a lot of tiny white snails all over, and after a rainfall, you could not walk to the post box without crunching quite a few larger snails underfoot.  It was both distressing and disgusting to feel and hear the crunch underfoot.  So, I tried this product in May 2020, and it helped a lot.  This past Spring/Summer (2021) I noticed a bit of a snail comeback as t'were, so I plan to retreat the property.  I have been waiting for the price to go down under $10 before I pull the trigger again.I cannot guarantee you will have as good results as I have had, but if you apply this generously in infested areas, I think you will see a great improvement.  I made sure to toss some of the bits into my neighbour's grassy area, too, which I am sure helped a lot.  My greatest pest problem now is the grasshoppers.  If only I could rid my garden and yard of those voracious grasshoppers, I would be very content indeed.  They decimated many of my plants again this year, so next year I plan to take drastic measures.  I am not keen to use chemicals, but if that is what it will take to rid my home of grasshoppers, then I am going to take that step.  This year I planned to use organic NOLO Bait in late May, but the company who makes NOLO sold out completely so early last Spring that it was unbelievable, and they never made any more the rest of the season.  Looking back, I should not have waited.  I thought they would make more available, so I waited, but now I realise that was a huge mistake.  I was overrun with grasshoppers all Summer through October again this year.  I will look for NOLO next Spring, BUT if they sell out as fast again, I will use chemicals.  I cannot go through another season with no help against the grasshopper hordes.  Thank heavens this product at least helped me to end the snail and slug problem for the most part.  If you have a snail/slug problem, I suggest you try this product.  Sprinkle generously in infested areas on days that are dry with no rain in the forecast.  You will not see an overnight miracle, but give it 2-4 weeks, and I think your snail/slug problem will be greatly improved.Recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Me with a chocolate cake. Mmmmm cake.What were we talking about again?RIGHT. SLUG KILLER.It almost works TOO good... I had a real problem after letting them go unchecked for about 12 years. I could go out after dark on any given night and there would be dozens on the siding, foundation and walkway. I did a combo of hand picking for several days (go out after dusk with rubber gloves and a ziplock bag and just collect all the slugs, seal em up and throw em in the trash) and then spread this stuff around their hidey holes where I know they sleep in the day (the crack between the walkway and the stairs and the stairs and hollow cement stoop, along flower bed edgers, the waterfall/pond, the woodpile, ect). I barely saw any slugs for several months after putting this out! I think I saw one lone slug on two occasions in the weeks to follow.But BEWARE. I messed with the ecosystem. The delicate balance of nature. And you know what happened? Mushrooms EXPLODED on my properrty. because slugs eat decaying matter and they LOVE a good mushroom feast. and I figured out that that's why I HAD so many slugs. Because apparently I have mushrooms out the wazoo! And fearful for my dogs health (I have the kind of mushrooms that sent Alice on her trippy ride to wonderland. My friend's dog died from eating one) I had now created a new chore. I had to walk around my half acre back yard and collect the bucket of mushrooms that sprouted overnight every single day.So as the slugs started to come back a little, I let them. I don't need to be slug free, I just don't want to worry about where I step when I run out to my car barefoot for my phone charger after dark, lest I get a slimy surprise underfoot!!

I am not sure why this review has me rate the ""flavor"" but I am going to assume it means did the snails like it. These are NOT edible so...yeah.Pros:*These work as intended but do not put them inside the dirt they will mold. I took the advice from other reviews and I sprinkled them around the pots on inside them and it still worked since they went after these instead of my plants.Cons:*After you wet these, or get your surface wet and then sprinkle these on top, they will get real sticky and start to mold after a while. I am so grateful for other reviews that warned me beforehand and sprinkling them on the outside worked just as well.Conclusion: Yes, they eat this and seemed to prefer it and it stopped them from eating my plants but don't put them inside your plant pots. I wouldn't recommend them if you are going to put them on dirt in the ground cause it will cause mold to grow. Also if you place them down make sure it isn't going to rain. It just washes them away.

insects,Chimique,B06ZYC7SX5,Joseph Duncan,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2022","Long time grower here. I recently got infested with russet mites in my garden. If you think spider mites are bad, russet mites make them look like family pets. Within a week of me noticing the damage (yellow, shriveled leaves and brownish buds) my entire grow was infested. I had some Monterey Garden Insect Spray  on hand. Its active ingredient is spinosad, a non-toxic bacterial byproduct that usually works on spider mites. I tried that, and although it helped, it was only slowing them down. So I went online and did some research and came up with two names: Humboldts Flower Shield and Trifecta Crop Control. Since Flower Shield was cheaper, and had a recognizable company name, I went with that.Oh, boy, big mistake. Not only did this product NOT do as it claims, which is kill russet mites, it also left a sticky residue on my buds. The residue is so tacky I was having trouble harvesting and trimming my plants. It also caused the outer layer of the buds to turn an unattractive orange-brown color, like they were burned or something. So I thoroughly washed my buds before hanging them up to dry, hoping that would remove the residue.Fast forward one week, and upon smoking my buds I was assaulted by a horrible soap-in-the-mouth and something unidentifiable flavor. I suppose I will have to toss this entire batch of bud and start over. Even though some of my buds escaped the wrath of the russet mites, Humboldts Secret Flower Shield made sure that what I managed to save was thoroughly ruined and unsmokable. They claim their product is non-toxic. But then they also claim it kills mites and would not leave a residue... so... yeah.If there is a silver lining to my tale of woe, it is that I finally did purchase the Trifecta Crop Control. It is ridiculously expensive, but it has brought my russet mite infestation under control, and does not appear to leave a sticky residue on anything. The only caveat being, it is rough on the leaves and will burn them if you do not follow instruction to a tee.In summary, stay far far away from this product. Get Trifecta Crop Control instead. Or just nuke your whole grow and start over from scratch if you get russet mites.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Williams,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2018","This product performs exactly as it says on everything it says it will...I have been gardening and breeding specific plants many years now and specifically medically the past half dozen years and the results get tested after harvest and I trust this product to do what it says while still allowing me to provide clean medicine to my patients and myself. Use it at the full recommended 2oz /gal to knock down the bugs/mites (Foliar spray and/or drench/dunk depending on where the pest lives) and 1oz/gal to knock down any of the PM or other fungi (non pest/insect uses)...INITIALLY, then after the first dose you should be able to cut it in half for the next couple treatments and then in half again for any follow up...It may not be cheap but it is economical IMO (mainly because it WORKS, lol) and if you stay on top of your spray schedule depending on what you are treating for then you will not require it for long because, again, IT WORKS! ;) ...if you are treating for mites I would recommend spraying at FULL strength TWO TIMES (3 days apart) using the best sprayer/atomizer you can get and really get in there now! The tops and bottoms of all leaves, the branches & stems and the top of your soil/mulch and even the floor surrounding the plants... I will sometimes add Dr. Bronners clear hemp liquid soap at a T per gal for pest treatments...helps with surface tension and further smothering the little bastards! After treatments and in between I like to spray with clean water and sometimes a foliar additive for vigor or growth like kelp (Golden Tree - Same company as this product), willow bark extract, etc., to help the plant recover from the issue that caused the treatments to begin with.

insects,Chimique,B071CQ8SDY,Joseph Duncan,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2022","Long time grower here. I recently got infested with russet mites in my garden. If you think spider mites are bad, russet mites make them look like family pets. Within a week of me noticing the damage (yellow, shriveled leaves and brownish buds) my entire grow was infested. I had some Monterey Garden Insect Spray  on hand. Its active ingredient is spinosad, a non-toxic bacterial byproduct that usually works on spider mites. I tried that, and although it helped, it was only slowing them down. So I went online and did some research and came up with two names: Humboldts Flower Shield and Trifecta Crop Control. Since Flower Shield was cheaper, and had a recognizable company name, I went with that.Oh, boy, big mistake. Not only did this product NOT do as it claims, which is kill russet mites, it also left a sticky residue on my buds. The residue is so tacky I was having trouble harvesting and trimming my plants. It also caused the outer layer of the buds to turn an unattractive orange-brown color, like they were burned or something. So I thoroughly washed my buds before hanging them up to dry, hoping that would remove the residue.Fast forward one week, and upon smoking my buds I was assaulted by a horrible soap-in-the-mouth and something unidentifiable flavor. I suppose I will have to toss this entire batch of bud and start over. Even though some of my buds escaped the wrath of the russet mites, Humboldts Secret Flower Shield made sure that what I managed to save was thoroughly ruined and unsmokable. They claim their product is non-toxic. But then they also claim it kills mites and would not leave a residue... so... yeah.If there is a silver lining to my tale of woe, it is that I finally did purchase the Trifecta Crop Control. It is ridiculously expensive, but it has brought my russet mite infestation under control, and does not appear to leave a sticky residue on anything. The only caveat being, it is rough on the leaves and will burn them if you do not follow instruction to a tee.In summary, stay far far away from this product. Get Trifecta Crop Control instead. Or just nuke your whole grow and start over from scratch if you get russet mites.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

insects,Chimique,B071CQ8SDY,C. Williams,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2018","This product performs exactly as it says on everything it says it will...I have been gardening and breeding specific plants many years now and specifically medically the past half dozen years and the results get tested after harvest and I trust this product to do what it says while still allowing me to provide clean medicine to my patients and myself. Use it at the full recommended 2oz /gal to knock down the bugs/mites (Foliar spray and/or drench/dunk depending on where the pest lives) and 1oz/gal to knock down any of the PM or other fungi (non pest/insect uses)...INITIALLY, then after the first dose you should be able to cut it in half for the next couple treatments and then in half again for any follow up...It may not be cheap but it is economical IMO (mainly because it WORKS, lol) and if you stay on top of your spray schedule depending on what you are treating for then you will not require it for long because, again, IT WORKS! ;) ...if you are treating for mites I would recommend spraying at FULL strength TWO TIMES (3 days apart) using the best sprayer/atomizer you can get and really get in there now! The tops and bottoms of all leaves, the branches & stems and the top of your soil/mulch and even the floor surrounding the plants... I will sometimes add Dr. Bronners clear hemp liquid soap at a T per gal for pest treatments...helps with surface tension and further smothering the little bastards! After treatments and in between I like to spray with clean water and sometimes a foliar additive for vigor or growth like kelp (Golden Tree - Same company as this product), willow bark extract, etc., to help the plant recover from the issue that caused the treatments to begin with.

As far as the insecticide, I am using that to control gnats in a few of my plants as well as spider mites in my bird of paradise. I have seen the amount of gnats decrease and we’ll see how the product will help long-term. You get a very concentrated mixture, which seems like it would last for a very long time. I also have reached out to customer service with multiple questions and they are very friendly and quick to respond which I think is incredibly important for us as customers to have that kind of awesome support.

insects,Organic,B0924ZGWBL,John C,"Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2023","I am rating this based on the fact that the product is good for organic gardening and the price and amount of usage you will get for the quantity purchased.  I do not know when I will get a chance to use this on an insect problem but will add to this post when I get a chance.  I have to assume it works as described and is truly organic based on the description.You get 2-8 ounce bottles for $27.  One bottle is used against insects, the other for fungi.The insecticide one states it killed bacterial cells and spent fermentation ingredients and can be used on food plants.  It is not a live product and purportedly kills through contact or ingestion of the product.  For foliar pests like caterpillars, mites, aphids and the like, you mix 1 ounce in a gallon of water and spray directly on the foliage.  So you can get a total of 8 gallons to spray on effected plants.  For Turf application, 2.5 ounces will treat 250 square feet; so the 8 ounce bottle with treat 800 square feet.The Fungicide bottle is a broad-spectrum fungicide that can be use for a broad range of foliar diseases, like downy mildew and leaf spot.  Its active ingredient is  a bacillus bacteria and spent fermentation media that is stated to be organic certified and good for organic vegetable gardens.  The application rates are the same as noted for the insecticide so an 8 ounce bottle with give 8 gallons for a foliar spray and will treat 800 square feet of turf.I have an organic vegetable garden and this product if it is effective as described would be useful if needed on my garden.  At $13.50 a bottle this would be fairly expensive particularly if used to treat turf.  For a small vegetable garden that occasionally needs some help to deal with bugs, it may not be that expensive and useful.",4.0 out of 5 stars,

The sprayer is easy to pump up and the pivoting handle is good for storage.  The pressure gauge is interesting but not much practical value.  Eventually a leak will develop at the hose at the bottom of the sprayer.  This can be resolved by replacing the plastic clamp with a metal hose clamp.  A complete selection of parts, repair diagrams, and repair instructions are available on-line.  There are a number of special parts that can be purchased to improve the sprayer.  A deluxe Solo harness will replace the standard harness which isn't very good for continual use.  A check valve can be installed to prevent dripping between the lever and the nozzle.  A brass or stainless steel or carbon fiber wand can replace the standard plastic one.  A check valve can be fabricated to stop any leakage out the top of the cap.  If the sprayer came with all these features I would give it five stars but it would then not have a competitive price.  For most users it is fine as it is.

This tank leaked like a sieve. If I had herbicide in tank  my lower back and legs would have been drenched.

I replaced it with this 'manual' Solo sprayer and it works great.  The ergonomics are great and the pump handle, which is adjustable, can be put in a convenient location.  I like the adjustable spray nozzle and also the fact that the maximum pump pressure can be changed on the unit I bought.  I also confirmed it will handle Roundup, although I can't imagine why anyone would sell a sprayer that doesn't since it's so popular.  Very good design at a good price.Now that I've had this for over a year, let me add these comments.  I spray diluted Roundup 1-2 times per month and the sprayer started leaking down my back and legs after just over a year (warranty had just expired).  However, I contacted Solo and they sent me a rebuild kit for them.  Kudos for doing this.  However, it's now a few months later and it's leaking again.

It's too heavy when it's filled to sling it over my shoulders like a back pack.  The little plastic clip that holds the shoulder strap to the tank broke the first time I tried that.

They were to replace my shindaiwa sprayers sp300 3-gallon, sp415 4-gallon & sp518 5 gallon sprayers. Newer versions of shindaiwa sprayers do have different numbering.  I do believe the solo sprayer fit better on your back as they are concaved for your back. The gauge is helpful if your into pressure & droplet size depending on your tip size. I felt like the straps were cheap & the strap connector to the bottom of the frame are plastic. I am use to metal clips. As I am 6 foot tall the hose length is not long enough. Windy days I try to keep the spraying tip closer to the ground the prevent wind drift. At my height & the length of the hose I need to bend over so the tip is only a few inches from the ground.

The little beasties don't kill the tree but I was getting tired of the ugly aphid clusters and being ""misted"" while walking or mowing beneath them. I read a lot of reviews of different treatments and this one seemed very promising.  After a bit of research I decided to take a 2-step approach of using this product and also spraying the leaves with a water-and-dish-soap mix.Earlier this spring the tree already had leaf damage and aphid clusters.  Within a week of using this product I could already see improvements.  Six weeks after the treatment the improvement is amazing.  There's no sign of aphids, the tree's leaves are dark and shiny, and there's even new growth.The product instructions are clear, and it's easy to use.  Basically you calculate the number of ounces to mix with water (based on the tree trunk size) and pour the mix around the base of the tree.  The jug is also packaged well, as it comes sealed in a bag within the box so you don't have to worry about leaks.  It's a good value, too, since I'll get a couple more seasons of treatment out of it.10/10 would buy again.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

The water:product ratio is simple, and could easily be in the listing, to help customers with an estimate of gallons needed! I highly recommend pre-measuring the tree trunk(s) to be treated, especially if you have several, and noting them in a similar fashion as I've pictured. Then do the math!The breakdown is easy:  1 ounce of product per 1 inch of the diameter of the tree trunk (at chest height). Or, 3 ounces per foot of shrub height. These amounts are added to 1 gallon (or 2) of water, and simply poured right around the base of the trunk.Needless to say, I'll need far more than 128 ounces (1 gallon) to treat the multiple trees in our yard.** I'll update my review in a couple months, allowing enough time for aphid elimination, based on the absence of honeydew all over our deck and outdoor furniture.UPDATE: It's obviously been more than a couple months. The product does work. But I also learned that application is necessary in the early spring (April) so that the tree has sufficient time to take-in the product prior to the start of aphid activity. Otherwise the aphids get a head start, damage begins, and you're playing catch-up the rest of the season.

An outside company had trimmed the trees back considerably and apparently infected them in the process.  All of the considerable new shoots were 100% infected, threatening to kill the trees.  I noticed immediate results but it didn't kill all the thrips and I needed two repeat applications before most of the thrips were gone.  Yes, it didn't kill them all, but enough for the trees to rebound, sending out healthy new shoots.  I suspect that on really big trees like these, the roots go very deep and the first couple of applications don't soak that deep and reach all the roots.  It would take time for the insecticide to get down to the bottom and outlying roots.  Trees don't mix all the water they absorb from all the roots into one reservoir to feed the branches.  Roots on the right side generally feed the branches on the right side.Emboldened, I tried a small diluted amount of it on a sapote fruit tree that had another more serious type of thrip infestation for 25 years.

Heilman,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2019","I had a severe infestation of soft scale (Coccidae) and resulting sooty mold on several of my rare palms, many of which are quite large and tall. Using horticultural oil would have probably worked but given the size of many of the palms and the difficulty in coating all leaf surfaces, both top and undersides, this would have been impractical. I had access to commercial ""industrial strength"" spray insecticide, but I hate using this type of stuff for obvious reasons. I decided to try this systemic and it worked like a charm. Within a week, almost all the scale had turned into dead white powdery masses that easily washed off with a water blast from the garden hose. The company says this treatment will last up to a year, so I will monitor the palms in a few months and reapply if necessary. It's convenient and easy to use and great value for the money. I'm not sure how it will work on hard scale and other pests but I assume it will do what it claims and if you have a soft scale problem I highly recommend it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

insects,Organic,B00BQ6V9IE,Ambull,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2015","My Eggplant plants became infested and almost destroyed with Colorado Potato Beetles this year. My experience with fighting them was as follows:1) Seven. The beetles laughed at this product.2) Neem oil. The beetles seemed to say ""ouch"", then went on with leaf munching.3) Thuricide. Seemed to have some effect, but not much. Everything I read indicated that this product will kill young larvae but not effect older beetles, but i found plenty of young remaining after each treatment.I tried all these products every couple of days which i hated subjecting my garden to, but it was obvious I would lose my prized eggplants otherwise, and I feared they would move on to my pepper and tomato plants next (which to date they have not moved onto).I think the biggest successes i experienced to that point was with controlling these guys with finger picking daily, but it was a losing battle.Finally the Bonide Colorado Beetle Beater arrived from Amazon (could not find this product locally). After ONE TREATMENT the beetles were whipped seemingly off the planet (or at the very least my garden)! Bravo, Bravo, BRAVO!Of note, this product does not seem to have effect on Japanese beetles.

Be careful not to hit any of your pollinators with the spray, because it will kill them too. Knock on wood, so far I am winning the battle.

(Actually it worked to prevent these weird ants at my new apartment from getting into plants too, idk what kind of ants they are, but not sugar ants) Ive tried lots of products to get rid of the fungus gnats- hydrogen peroxide, cinnamon, rocks and sand on top of soil, neem oil, other chemicals but those didn’t work at all and were such a hassle that I absolutely recommend this stuff. I don’t spray it o , I just dump it on my plants thoroughly (til it runs out the bottom) with this stuff a couple of times- in place of my regular watering in order to kill the baby flies and larvae. EWW. Also I used this preventatively on other plants too because I couldn’t isolate the main one easily and you don’t know what has already spread to the soil of the other nearby plants. For any flying around: the Katchy (or whatever brand you find) UV light plug-in trap thing at night and the annoying yellow sticky traps scattered around making my place look real tacky. This product and how I used didn’t cause any damage to my houseplants. I didn’t try to avoid leaves either but a few plants have leaves I avoid getting wet so I put this stuff in a bottle with a pointy nozzle to be more precise and miss the leaves and not waste it. Best to bottom water in the future as much as possible to prevent this issue entirely. This only has happened to me in pots that don’t have a drainage hole meaning I have to water from the top like a normal person.Idk where the fungus gnats come from. They are just around I guess. Probably happened when I got a plant that unnoticeable had a few in the soil even though I do check new plants for pests but it just be like that sometimes when you buy as many plants as I do.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I’ve never had any problems with it killing plants or flowers like others have although the packaging has changed since my last purchase. Before with the pure white bottle I had no issue with leakage or loss of product, but with this alteration I have gotten *soaked* with problems. Ha! But truly the new product packaging comes in a bag, which held in leakage, but not completely as there are circle cut holes in the bag. The new handle fits your palm weirdly as its circular and not flat rectangular. And the new locking mechanism I can see it being needed for families with young children but I can’t see how a child couldn’t figure out how to turn it. As I accidentally did before I knew it was a lock, I looked down the nossel moving it and sprayed it in my face. Luckily I had glasses on but if my own stupidity can help another families trip to poison control I’d best share it.

So it seems like you must spray a lot to coat every leaf to ensure the spray physically touches the bugs before it dries off in order for it to work. You can’t hope that it will kill the aphids if they start eating a leaf that you treated a few days ago.

insects,Chimique,B003B3N5YQ,Zingo,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2019","I'm using this for spider mites on succulents. There aren't many, no webs, but I can see them using a microscope. This does work better than alcohol. Know that if you're using this on succulents, some may handle it well and others may not survive the treatment because they are so sensitive to moisture, even if it's only on the leaves - particularly varieties of echeveria and other high light succs that rely on a heavy coating of farina (jades, for instance, don't have this problem). The oil in this also may leave a shiny layer which helps kill mites but may also inhibit the farina (waxy coating) from properly restoring itself. Because the farina builds up slowly and protects the leaves from bright light, it's important to slowly introduce them to the sun and best not to give them full afternoon sun/lighting until the shiny neem oil coating is gone and the powdery farina is able to build back up, otherwise you will likely get burns on the leaves and get some die back.

It took two sprayings - I took the tree outside, sprayed it, let it dry, brought it back in, waited a week and a half and repeated the process.  The first spraying killed most of the scale, but some survived; they really need to be hit with the oil, and the little buggers hide.  So then I did it again and got the newly hatched and the survivors.  I am checking to see if I get more, but the oil did a good job.  Just scrape off the dead scales with your fingernails; they don't fall off or disappear, then check the tree later and you can tell if you need to do it again.

Then I was wondering why the Ghost and Habanero Pepper Plants I was trying to start for next years outdoor plot would either not sprout, or would sprout then ""die off"" a few days later...Temp too cold/hot? Nope seemed fine around 70 to 75 F all day and nightWas it lack of organic foods or lack of bennies/mycos in the soil? Nope that just made things worseWas is lack of or over watering? No that isn't the answer either, things still getting worseWait a second... what is that moving in the soil, on the plants, and in the flowers?!? BUGS!!!We had aphids, thrips, leafminers, spider mites, and gnats all having their way with our poor plants and future sprouts...Tried every kind of ""organic"" concentrate I could find at the local stores, used Worry Free Pyrethrin, Safer Insect Soap, Horticultural Oil, and Neem Oil was all they were selling in the stores... some things ""worked"", but not really in the long run... Pyrethrin and Horticultural Oil would kill every bug it touched but a few days later the bugs were back with a vengeance exploding in numbers and eating more of the plants... and those two didn't do anything for the bugs eating away at the roots of my plants. Insect Soap and Neem Oil didn't do a thing either, seemed to feed them and make the bugs stronger :(So I researched and ordered spinosad 11.6 percent concentrate... figured I would get over 300 gallons of ""ready to use"" product and Conserve SC was the least expensive product in the long run compared to ""Dead Bug Brew"" and other 0.5 percent versions of spinosad that cost $30 a quartMade a mix of spinosad and water, filled a quart sized spray bottle and used about 5 gallons of spinosad/water mixture to drench the soil in our planters... should have seen all the bugs come rushing out of the soil when the water started to drench through... easy enough to take care of them, spray those emerging bugs down along with the rest of the plant, watch those evil bugs twitch and die and move onto the next plant :)* Edit * Applied a second treatment of spinosad about a week later and noticed 1/4 to 1/2 the amount of bugs come rushing out of each planterAfter I was done watering with spinosad the second time I went and ordered 30 million nematodes from Arbico Organics to finish this battle and to keep those pests away for months at a time",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

About a week later, my grass is green and healthy.For reference, I water all 4 zones of my yard for an hour daily. Tall fescue.

insects,Chimique,B01G4Z1HTW,JWINK,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2020","I have used Scotts brand of fertilizer for many years, using the different varieties depending on the season.  Here the summers are long and tend to be hot and dry as well as having a large insect population, so I use this every summer to help strengthen the grass as well as control the insects.  I have never had an issue with burning the grass.  If you follow the directions and use a spreader to put onto your yard, you will have no issues. Do not over sow the fertilizer or you will burn your lawn.  I apply some variety of fertilizer every 3 to 4 months, with the Summerguard version in the summer. Make sure you lightly water your grass immediately before you apply the fertilizer as that helps the fertilizer control the weeds. Also water your lawn thoroughly a couple days later to help the nutrients get into your lawn.  This works well at helping strengthen the lawn and to a lesser extent bug control.  I also use a bug control product to supplement this throughout the year.This 15 lb. bag is a bit small and I think it is a bit pricey compared to other brands, but is comparably priced currently ($25 per 15 lb bag) to the box stores.4 stars",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

insects,Chimique,B00C2R54QY,Placeholder,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2016","We live in an area with hot, humid summers and lots of shade trees - so our mosquitoes were pretty bad. Just a week or so after spraying this product on and around all the bushes and flowerbeds, there was a dramatic decrease in the number of flying pests. It also (so far) stopped the bad flea problem our neighborhood has been experiencing. Yet, it doesn't appear to have impacted the lizard population, and I still see an occasional bee (we never had a lot), which is a plus. I've only had this down a few months, so I can't say if it really lasts 6 months or not. As I have seen a small increase in mosquitoes recently, I suspect a more realistic expectation is to plan on applying 3x per year, rather than two. Certainly if your city gets a lot of rainfall. Still, it's far superior to toxic pesticides that need applied monthly, or organic treatments that wash away easily. And unlike conventional bug sprays, the insects don't develop resistance to the IGR. We spray it ourselves with a hand-held sprayer we also got on Amazon for 13 bucks. More effective than the pest control companies, at 1/3 the cost. You can't beat that",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I was going absolutely crazy! I had never had an encounter with fleas before, so my first instinct was to go and buy flea bombs and set them off in the home, so I did.  I went back to the home a few days after I had set the bombs off and the fleas were just as bad.  I tried spraying with just an adulticide, Tempo SC, this worked immediately to kill the living fleas, but then they started to hatch again and then the cycle started all over again.  So I did some research online and this was recommended along with the adulticide.  I used this product mixed with Premetherin and sprayed the homes inside and out. I also vacuumed diligently once a day. Within 2 weeks,there were no sign of fleas, I sprayed this product by itself again after 2 weeks for good measure.  It has been 2 months now and we haven't seen any sign of fleas in either home.  This will be my go to product if I encounter a flea infestation again, its awesome!  We also treated our dog by flea combing 2-3 times a day in a bathtub filled with 1-2 inches of soapy water so that when the fleas fell in the water during combing, they died immediately.  Our vet also gave our dog a pill which would kill the fleas and deform any eggs laid by the fleas that would inhibit them from hatching.  With all of these steps we were able to get rid of the fleas.  Its a lot of time and effort, but it's worth it in the end.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Nothing was working, and I was about ready to bite the bullet and hire an exterminator to come bomb the house.I received this order almost exactly 1 month ago today.The day I received it I mixed it up 4 ML / gallon of water and sprayed my entire yard, around all doors, windows, and the foundation of the house, and the first floor and basement of my house as well as the stairs leading to the 2nd floor.About a week later I wasn't seeing much improvement and sprayed the whole yard and first floor again.This label suggests multiple treatments appx. three weeks apart.In the last month I have gone from pulling 15-20 fleas off a 5 lb dog to finding 1-3.  My legs have almost completely healed from where I was being bitten.  My dog's hair is growing back (she was scratching and chewing it off).  I will be following the suggestion of the label and treating my yard and home again now that 3 weeks has passed, but this seems to have done the trick as of right now.

However, after suffering through having tons of fleas in my house for over 3 months, and trying sevin dust, Black Flag Xtreme Flea spray, Viper, and other products, I am very thankful that after the 2 weeks specified on the bottle as the average time to see a noticeable decrease in fleas, and the time to respray if needed, my house was almost flea free!  Only a few jumped in the bowls after 2 weeks.  I didn't even respray, and the fleas are completely gone after 3 1/2 weeks!  Like some have suggested, on blogs and such, I put out white bowl with water and soap ALL over the house.  You just couldn't imagine the amount of fleas that jump into these bowls - which only exposed the magnitude of the problem I had.  Fleas reproduce SO rapidly, that if you don't get a handle on the problem early, it will then get MUCH worse before it gets better!1) I would recommend this product to anyone with a serious flea problem - just give it the time allowed to work!2) Vacuum your house slowly EVERY DAY!3) Put out low profile white bowls with soap and water all around the infected areas (I put 5 in each room).4) Don't wear white socks around the house - fleas are EXTREMELY attracted to white.

I also see a lot of dead bugs around the foundation.I did everything I can do to make the area inhospitable to springtails but they have quite a foothold in the soil. I needed some extra help.

insects,Chimique,B07B7GJ65D,BeatlesFan,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2022","Bayer makes Temprid FX and they say...""For bed bugs, do not exceed an application rate of 0.075% - 0.27 fluid ounces (8 milliliters) of Temprid FX Insecticide per gallon of water."" I don't understand why less is better. I use probably three times as much concentrate which I mix with water. I estimate that I use 25 ml per gallon. I don't care how much I need to spend. I just want those bedbugs dead!Also, you can't keep the mixed Temprid around more than 24 hours, because water destroys the microencapsulated spheres that are in the concentrate. The microencapsulated spheres of insecticide are not going to break down if the water in your mixed spray evaporates within an hour or two. This leaves behind a dry deposit. I have never sprayed Temprid on live bedbugs because I rarely see them. I know that if you spray Temprid on live bedbugs, there is quick knockdown. What I'm more interested in is how the dry deposits kill the bedbugs. After the spray I applied has dried, I have seen bedbugs strolling along on the treated surfaces! It is frustrating that they don't die right away, but I understand that Temprid will kill them within a few hours or a day. The microencapsulated spheres stick to the legs of the insect and start to release the chemicals over many hours into the nervous system of the insect. I don't have the patience to wait for the insect to die. I will kill any bedbug that I see. However, when I am not looking, I am hoping that the Temprid dry deposits are coating the legs of the bedbugs and the bedbugs will die within the next 24 hours. That's what I am hoping for. I can't stay awake 24 hours a day watching for bedbugs that come out of hiding!And also, Temprid is supposed to look like milk. And it's not supposed to have a strong smell. That's why the insecticide is microencapsulated. The water that you mix evaporates and leaves behind a dry deposit of microencapsulated spheres.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Inside did not leave any residue... used it as a general bug/ants protection.2 days later: Bugs/flies/BLACK WIDOW laying messed up on the groud. Seems like it doesn't kill upon the contact. They just get literally messed up, laying on the ground twitching until they pass out... Seems like it affects their nervous system. My kid left a door open an inch for few hrs bunch of flies entered. They all went to windows which I sprayed and now few hrs later they just laying chilling on the ground - trying to get up but can't...Time will tell on longevity.

I’ve been using it for years for maintenance spraying for bed bugs and other insects. Do your self a favor and read the EPA’s Pesticide Application Core Manual: the manual that pesticide applicators have to test to get a license to apply pesticides. One product is not sufficient to deal with BB’s, it takes a multi vector approach. I use Crossfire and Temprid FX. They’ve kept my building BB and other insects free for years. I also back it up with Diatomaceous Earth under appliances, in plumbing holes in walls, and under cabinets. Heat is not affective alone: I’ve used it alone and found that heat can be defeated by common insulating materials in a home (carpet, walls). Heat will kill them that day, but remember, BED BUGS ARE HITCH HIKERS. You can get rid of them with heat and pick up a new set while staying at a hotel, traveling on a plane, or sitting in a chair in someone’s office. You need a residual to prevent further infestation.

By the time we realized it... his room was INFESTED with them.  I sprayed this chemical, along with a powder that I got to spray into the walls and cracks.  The bed bugs died.  But then they came back.  So, I mixed up some more, pulled the moldings off the walls and sprayed this stuff (very liberally) into all of the cracks and crevices, including those exposed by removing the molding... and they died, and we haven't seen any more for 6 months.  We also haven't seen any roaches, spiders, or any other bugs.  We live in rural Northern Florida... so that's saying something.  I highly recommend this product for pest control... but don't be scared to use a TON of it if you have bed bugs, and pull the moldings off the walls in the effected areas to really get the solution in there.  It leaves a good residue behind after it dries.  Worked great for us.UPDATE:  So, it's 1/11/20... over 6 months later.  We haven't seen a single bed bug.  Not one.  So, I think this stuff is really amazing.  In addition, we also have been free of any roaches... which living in a heavily wooded part of Northwest Florida, is saying something.  Of course the prep work I mentioned earlier is a must... simply can't break the reproduction cycle without proper prep, but this spray is amazingly effective, when coupled with the powder filling all of the cracks and crevices they like to hide in for a good residual kill of future hatchlings.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

As others have said the sprayer is difficult to control. I reccomend applying at night for 2 reasons. 1. It will kill bees if it comes directly in contact with them. The residue will not kill them if sprayed a few hours before they start foraging for pollen. 2. The scent seems to REALLY stir up wasps. If you have wasps in the application area spraying when they are active may pose a safety issue. Other than that, my plants appear much healthier for a few weeks after application.

After reading the reviews I was just that more careful in reading directions and the hook up to the hose.  There was absolutely no problem.  You will need to pull back on the stop before you can move the sprayer (I found this a little hard but pulled back as far as I could then used a small straight screwdriver to pull back the rest).  I was careful in connecting the hose and did not tighten it too tightly.  And walla it worked the sprayer worked beautifully.  The rose bush is covered and it was easy.  In detaching it I used the same gentle manner.  I turned the sprayer to the stop position and replaced the stop.  I did not encounter leaking or broken attachments.  On the issue of smell yes there is a smell but it is very mild.  I cannot understand how others found it to be strong unless they were spraying it on directly without mixing it with water.  Anyway it is mild and not unpleasant.  I will wait to see it's effectiveness on the eradication of the pests however I know from experience with other natural essential oil repellents that they do work.

Prior to purchase of this product, I largely lost the use of my deck in the evening and, since the daytime-biting mosquitoes were also present, I began to feel like a prisoner in my own home from May through September. I first tried a mosquito zapper and while it killed scores of the little buggers, it barely made a dent in their plague-like numbers. This product changed that. It was sprayed nearly two months ago directly on the mosquitoes where they congregate during the day and did not stain the wood siding, which was a concern. Better yet, it appears to have deterred new mosquitoes from replacing the ones that were killed off. This product does not have a strong odor, did not stain my painted siding and was worth every penny.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

insects,Chimique,B0C6Q42NKD,Tharin,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2021","This bug spray is cleverly (and not innocently) marketed like a wonder insecticide that will kill everything it gets near. This is a permethrin spray. That's a repellent, not an insecticide, and mosquitos are tougher than most bugs you find in suburbia. It works by stinking and thus disguising what really attracts mosquitos, and that's CO2 in human breath. They're good at detecting movement too.This smells sulphury like garlic. This may confuse your mosquitos but they'll be back tomorrow night to rekindle relationships. Giving everyone fresh garlic pizza might work better than this stuff.Well, it's live and learn. Mosquitos are killed by direct spray contact by an insecticide (either by wetting or by misting/fogging) or by suction trapping at a CO2 source.

It worked to some extent, but I was battling aphids and some whiteflies all winter long, and I couldn’t kill enough of them to save a couple of my plants from dying. (They lost all leaves and then aphids attacked the new growth). I wish I had used this stuff last year, because now if I see bugs I do a thorough spray, getting underneath leaves, and I can tell they’re dead almost right away, they turn odd colors. Even with a bad infestation in some of my plants, this just annihilates the bugs after one round of spraying. I have tonsss of plants including bonsai trees and houseplants, and so far none of them have had any reaction to being sprayed, even though I know some are sensitive to things like neem oil. It seems particularly effective for aphids and whiteflies, but I don’t have any other kinds of bugs so I’m not sure how effective it would be with others.

First of all, I was happy to find the top was firmly attached, nothing was broken & no liquid was juicing up the inside of the protective bag or the box.I've been using soapy water on aphids and the like, as it basically gives bugs the runs & they die of dehydration (per at least a few gardening shows/books). ANYhow, I'm not exactly sure what has been eating my roses, but it's definitely a muncher, not a disease. I watched videos & thought I knew what it was (not aphids, they're easy), without going out again to look at the underside of the leaves. When I went out to spray this I didn't see any of the suspected green slug worms, but sprayed the heck out of everything, including both sides of the leaves I removed.I can tell by the smell & consistency that it's not water & dish soap. It's true insecticidal soap. I have a good feeling this has/will quickly solve my rosebuG problem fast.I'll try to remember to add pix once my poor rose is showing proof of recovery.

I'm very disappointed! We need bees 🐝  both for pollination in my garden and for the very survival of all plants on our planet!The product instructions state that to avoid killing bees one should apply the product at dusk or dawn ""when bees are less likely to be present."" That was my first clue that this wasn't the product for me...Squash bees are most active at dawn and other pollinators like butterflies are active at dusk... the last thing I want to do is to kill my pollinators!!! I'd rather let the pests eat my garden.Neem oil concentate mixed with water and a drop or two of catille soap to distribute the neem oil in water does work to kill hornworms, mildew diseases, baby squash bugs (before they get their hard shells) and supposedly the black flea beetles on my eggplant, it just needs to be reapplied frequently especially after a rain.But the neem oil doesn't kill my bees!!!I'd never test that theory by actually spaying bees or the flowers right before bees will visit...

insects,Chimique,B004BLNVMS,surfzombie,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2023",I purchased one container of this product a while back. I have a large property in the California high desert and was having some problems with bugs eating my plants and trees in the summertime. I tried those spray on insecticides for plants but had mixed results and the effectiveness of those products did not seem to last very long. This product was used for smaller sized Mulberry trees and small pomegranate plants. Those insects seem to prefer the younger plants I have for their daily meals.The insect control concentrate has worked fine. I have not had any problems at all with the bugs returning after application. It sure is much easier than continually spraying the plant or tree over a long period of time with some other product like I did before. If the bugs come back again this summer I will need to order another container for new applications. I give this product a thumbs up for a purchase choice.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
insects,Chimique,B004BLNVMS,JT,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2020","I have previously used really strong solutions of imidacloprid for my front yard bushes to take care of beetles and other pests. It was really easy to use since this is a systematic pesticide. That is, you just mix with water and pour it on the roots. The plants takes in the imidacloprid and stores it in its tissue so that you only need to apply the pesticide once a year and no further treatment is needed. However, the concentration of imidacloprid for my frontyard treatment is far too strong to be used on the edible crops and plants that I grow in my backyard.That is where this pesticide comes in. It only contains 0.235% Imidacloprid making it suitable for edible crops. Like the stronger concentration pesticides, it is systematic, so you only apply it once a year. The low concentration means that the fruits are safe to eat, and since I am only spraying once a year, you end up saving a lot more compared to other pesticides that require a spray every week or two. Since the chemical only affects insects that feed on the plants (usually harmful pests), this is safe for most pollinators like bees.I have actually had this product in mind for the last year. Amazon was offering this product at $13.54 after the coupon discount (The normal MSRP is $26.99), so there was no reason not to buy it.This pesticide is designed for fruits and vegetables. But there are a few things to note. The Pre-harvest Interval, that is, the time needed after each application before you can harvest the crops vary from plant to plant. So you have to check the label prior to use. While it can be used on the listed vegetables, in many cases, the Pre-harvest Interval is 21 days. So you cannot harvest the vegetables for 21 days after application. This might be problematic when it comes to short harvest crops. E.g. Some vegetables may only take 3 or 4 weeks from seed to harvest, so that rules out the use of this pesticide. The pesticide is applying by mixing in water and then pouring it around the roots, so there is no need to spray anything on the plants. It's mostly practical for fruits and less useful for leafy vegetables.If you are a busy gardener and have no time to spray your fruit trees every other week, I would highly recommend this product.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I couldn't even stand under them as I would get ""rained"" on by aphid excrement that was like a light mist. I did not want to use a poison and held out as long as I could, spraying them with neem oil but that did not seem to help at all. So I finally broke down and bought this. I made sure not to use it while the trees were flowering due to the fact apparently it is really toxic to bees. I applied it at the end of the growing season and this spring the trees are all doing really great. The new leaf growth is untouched by pests whereas normally they would take advantage of that.

Unbeknownst to me, this sapling had a terrible mealybug infestation - which I then took into my house and placed next to my other plants. I returned from vacation to find an all out infestation on *all* of my indoor plants.I bought this product to try and eliminate the bugs. I cleared and quarantined my plants in batches, waiting 8 - 12 weeks after application / the bugs disappearing to make sure the bugs had been cleared out before reintroducing treated plants to the rest of my (clean) plants. I could clearly see the difference in my plants, as slowly but surely the mealybugs vanished.Most of my plants are bug free and living happy lives. But a few others still show signs of mealys - a few cotton puffs here and there and an occasional little mealybug. I have poured WAY over the suggested amount and concentration, especially for indoor plants, and the bugs still survive on these plants (mostly succulents). Unfortunately I didn't realize the bugs were still present and placed infected plants next to my Bonsai, which then became infected. I treated my bonsai with this product. It was dead within a month.This product helped 80% of my plants, so I can't tell you not to buy it. But it also didn't solve my problem, it killed my favorite plant, and allowed the mealybugs to spread. So use with caution, and follow-up with supplemental care.

insects,Chimique,B09QBSLM4Y,WorldTravelr,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2022","I don't really like chemicals and pesticides around my fruit plants ... certain chemicals are pretty natural and others are not. I tend to put this in the 'not' category, even though most sources (in the US unyways) say that this is relatively safe. Right off the bat, I will say that this is an outdoor only product. I have a large, potted lemon tree in my house, which spends the cold winters indoors and in front of a large window for the sun. Originally, I ordered it for that purpose ... but I read that you should not use products (especially concentrated ones) with the active ingredient Imidocloprid for indoor plants. Strike one.Imidocloprid has varying reports as to it's safety. For the US, it is listed as safe to sell ... and the magazine Entomology Today lists it as safe for pollinators and bees when used in moderation. Imidoclopril is banned in the European Union as some studies show that it may be harmful to honeybee populations and pollinators. There isn't a ton of concrete evidence on either side and there are conflicting reports at times.Imidoclopril is a pesticide which works by affecting the nervous systems of insects negatively. You can see by my photos of the product's labels what types of insects this will target. This is very heavily geared towards citrus pests ... whiteflies and aphids are big issues in the north and south, whereas the Asian Citrus Pysllids are very, very bad bugs to have on your citrus crop ... and unlike whiteflies and aphids which can be eradicated once you find them, once your tree is infected with Pysllids, that's pretty much it for the tree's ability to produce edible fruit. So, for those with outdoor citrus trees, this product might be worth its weight in gold.I used this on my tree outside on my deck. It's chilly at night but not cold enough to harm the tree. A week later, the infestation is still there as strong as before. The only thing which seems to get rid of whiteflies and aphids, albeit temporarily, is Neem oil sprayed onto the leaves.This works by measuring the distance of the branches from the trunk out to the end of the furthest branch (dripline radius) and using the chart I photographed. For small trees, like mine, the dripline radius is less than 3 feet, so only 1.5 ounces is needed. For large apple or orange trees, you'd need 1/3 or more of the bottle. So the bottle will do 2-3 large trees ... or lots of small trees or bushes. The labels say its safe for everything from blueberry bushes to fruit trees. However, I don't think after seeing how ineffective it was against my whiteflies if it's worth putting a chemical like this on my fruit baring trees.Imidaclorpid is the Active Ingredient and measures .023% vs. 99.765% inactive ingredients, which are likely water and dye. This is a concentrate, so you can imagine how strong Imidaclorpid is, if way less than 1% of this product is active ingredient. Likely why your honeybees will be safe if you use it ... maybe.Overall, this wasn't the most effective Bioadvanced product I've used. I do think many of their products (once owned by Bayer ... then sold off around a decade ago) are good for citrus bug temporary prevention and for the most part safe to use. However, this product didn't really work for me and the warnings give me pause to use it again ... so I likely will not. For bigger, planted, outdoor citrus trees, the protection against bugs which will do your plant harm might be worth it to you.",3.0 out of 5 stars,

The application is very easy: look at the label and figure out how much you need based on your tree's drip line size, pour into a gallon of water and apply around the entire drip line of the tree.

The active ingredient is imadacloprid, which is a very effective insecticide, killing a wide range of bugs from apids to scale to leafhopper and more!! Because it can be taken up by through the roots and than transported throughout the plant, you get fantastic protection. Application is very easy since this is a liquid formulation. You dilute the insecticide and apply around the base of the tree.

insects,Chimique,B004TT1PHA,Bonnie Buchanan,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2021","After YEARS!, I mean YEARS of what I learned last year was ‘Scale’ growing on my mum’s Japanese Magnolia Trees (2) (see the pic = YUCK!) I did some research, and learned about this product. Initially, I tried to treat the plant using just diluted Neem Oil spray. Unfortunately, the treatment did more damage than good (when treating w/Neem oil it really has to be diluted or it will burn the plant’s leaves, etc..)..Apparently, all I needed to do was get this stuff, Shake out a bit and scatter it around the base of the trees. The way this product works, is that the product sits at the base of the plant, and when watered, the product then soaks into the ground and the plant then uptakes the product into its system, and when the pests (scale, gnats, aphids, etc..), attack the plant, they basically get a mouth full of YUCK!🤮 and either die or go away. DO NOT USE WHEN RAINING! as the product will not soak into the ground and treat that specific plant, but instead, it will go where ever the water goes and potentially contaminate your garden and any edible plants growing nearby, and you DO NOT want to EAT anything treated by this product!I figured “Meh, Why Not?!” I’ll give it a try at least, at approx. $23USD, it was well worth it to try.Around February, I had my mum (82yo) treat the trees, which consisted of just shaking out the designated amount of product and tossing It around underneath both trees. I stated her age to emphasize that anyone can use this product, it’s that easy to use.By March, both of her Japanese Magnolia trees put out blooms like they had not in YEARS! I mean they were GORGEOUS! We had neighbors comment on how beautiful the trees were. All that, compared to previous years, where both trees were sickly, covered in leaves, but few if any blooms, and almost every joint in the trees had these yellow black ‘lumps’. I now know the ‘lumps’ were ‘scale’, and the black stuff was likely black soot/fungus. We live with some tall trees behind us/on our east side and the trees although located further out in the yard, probably both were infected by the black soot being in the air/drifting on the wind and landing on the trees. But, after this treatment, all GONE! *smiles*😁👍🏼I HIGHLY RECOMMEND You try this product on ANY “NON-Edible” plant. Do NOT use on ANYTHING You plan to EAT! Because, this product works by your plant up-taking it into the plant itself and distributing it throughout the plant’s roots, stems, leaves, blooms/fruit, etc...Also, You only need to make sure to use this product far enough in advance of Spring/Summer that the plant has time enough to up-take it and distribute it internally. BEST OF ALL, You only need to use this product ONCE every YEAR!! (12mths!)••••> PRO’s: ••••••• EASY USE - Just Shake it out and distribute it under the plant at the base.• PESTS / Lots! = This product treats a WIDE VARIETY of plant pests and disease(s).• QUANTITY / Lasts! = Depending upon the area/plants you wish to treat, it really only takes a little bit of product. Plus, as You only need to apply the product ONCE YEARLY, a little bit goes a long way, and the container size should last you a long time.• ANNUALLY = You only need to apply this product ONCE YEARLY!• COST = The approx $23 cost is minimal when you consider the quantity you get, along with the amount of product needed to treat a plant, considering all of that, the price is cheap!••••> CON’s: •••••• TOXIC = This product is toxic enough that it should NOT be used on ANY plant that produces Edible Produce/Fruit. Because the plant up-takes the product into ALL parts of the plant, the stem, leaves, blooms/fruit, so that anything edible will be full of this toxic product, not edible and toxic if eaten.• CONTAMINATION = MUST be applied to plant at base on a dry day, because otherwise, the product will spread to where ever the water it sits in travels and can potentially contaminate other plants that produce edible fruit/produce, making it in edible or if eaten, potentially poison whomever eats it.• TIMING = Must be applied early enough before Spring/Summer that the plant has time to up-take the product into itself internally and distribute it through out itself.••••> OVERALL OPINION: •••••Overall I feel this is a GREAT product to use and try, it worked WONDERS to completely cure two very over run and sickly Japanese Magnolia Trees, which are now producing Gorgeous Blooms! And, I no longer feel bad/guilty, because the trees look so bad/sickly (& I don’t have to worry about the scale spreading to our other plants!!) Unfortunately, I do not have any of the pics from the trees blooming this year, because I waited too long and there has been so much rain, BUT, I’ll try to update with pics next time they bloom, to show you just how gorgeous the tree and blooms are now, all cured, green lush and entirely covered in beautiful purple flowers!😁👍🏼",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
insects,Chimique,B004TT1PHA,product2review,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2020","I had to use this on my Aloe Cacti I brought home from the Outdoor Market that were selling plants and they had rolley polley all in the bottom of the container and where coming out and trying to go to my other plants.  So I had to use this right away in the the summer heat to protect my other potted plants and it burned all the bottom leaves , so I am glad I waited before putting it in any of my other new nursery plants and will have to wait until it is cool outside before subjecting them to this hopefully they won't get any bugs until the cooler temps get here.  So summer is a definate NO for using this product.  Also it has food in it so there is no need to buy food too because it has it in it.  But all the bugs are gone and I expect that this product will do what it is supposed to do but you will get some burning, if done right you plants should live and recover.  I would give less than the recommended 6 mo dose and I would give it in Sep 15 and  March 15 every year. It burned my plant for about two weeks before it quit burning and I would give it a good wash with water if you see it burning so it will get down into the planter or ground and the concentrate dissapates.  It works it just a bummer to see your plants get burned from a needed product when they looked good before.Update:  It is October now and it is 90 degrees daytime and 60 at night  now and I have had no trouble putting this on my Oleander what so ever or my Agave Cacti in small doses at a time.  Because of the experience with my Aloe Cacti I have learned it is better to just divy up the portions  that I would be giving them in September and in March and take those 2 doses and making it 1 and then dividing it by 6 months and that is what I am feeding the plant every month during the WINTER.  That way when spring comes and the bugs hatch outside my plants will be fertilized from the Winter feedings and will stay away from them until it gets to hot for the bugs and I won't have to worry about burning them in the spring when the weather starts turning hot/cold.  This way it is in the plants root system.  It is just to hot where I live and no shade is cause for disaster.  I did use this on a Boxwood and it does not like it at all.  The leaves are not dark green anymore and are drying up so it works good on some plants and others it can be sensitive to.  Now my Agave is not having any problems with it and it; babies are shooting out from the soil.  But I am only giving tsp measurements every month because I don't want to risk burning my plants.  As far any tree goes  the label does say (not to use) it on a certain tree but I can't remember the name right now.  But it definately is hit and miss with this product  depending on the plant species lets see what happens after a winter of feeding and see it the bugs stay away in the spring that will be the real test come spring I will let you know then.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

This was suggested by the clerk and after one application I found dead beetles on the ground the next day. Making SURE you prepare enough for the size of your tree is crucial. Skimping and stretching the mixture does not work. Due to extreme cases I have treated twice in one summer with excellent results! Highly recommend the liquid as opposed to granules.

I had a juniper that got something that was turning all of the limbs rust colored. I had to cut it down as it just wasted away, and died very quickly. I have 2 others that started doing the very same thing. That caused me to search for a treatment and I found this wonderful product. You only have to apply it once every 12 months, and it is so easy to use. The junipers showed almost immediate results. Crape myrtles with scale have gotten healthier. All of my trees are doing so well. I gave it 4 stars because the last time I purchased this it was in a 10lb. container for around the same price as 2 4lb. containers. I am not going to return it and order the 10 lb. container because I am needing to complete treatment for this year. Hopefully price will remain the same when I order next year.

insects,Chimique,B004TT1PHA,BuckeyeHog,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2015","I bought this product because it is recommended to control wooly aphids on hackberry trees. I discovered this problem about three years ago when a hackberry tree on the corner of the patio started depositing black residue on everything underneath. I treated the tree late last fall, even though I knew it was too late. But, I hoped the systemic insecticide would be stored by the roots as the tree went dormant.I also treated a river birch that always had about half the leaves infested with something that distorted the leaf and had a bumpy texture. This is a big tree and I had no idea how to use a spray.In April, as the leaves began to bud, I did a full treatment on the hackberry. We had a very wet spring, and the roots should have had a good dose.In June, the hackberry looks very healthy. I have not seen any of the wooly aphids. But, the jury is still out on whether this works. July and August is when it happens.I do want to report that the river birch looks great. The leaves are shiny and dark green. This is a notable difference. I do not see any infested leaves. That is a Wow.I'm starting to like this product. I'm tempted to use it on all my ornamentals.UpdateIt is now August 12, and there is no sign of the aphid infestation. I do occasionally see one of the little bastards floating in the air, but not like in the past. There is no black residue below the tree. I also treated a crepe myrtle near the tree that usually got covered with the residue, and that plant has been amazing. It might be the fertilizer, but the leaves are bigger and dark green, and the flowers are awesome.UpdateOctober 12. I say it worked.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

insects,Chimique,B004TT1PHA,Narcosleepy,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2013","I have a hackberry tree and for years it had ""hackberry nipple gall."" This is when the leaves of the hackberry tree get yellow bumps on them. I was told hackberry nipple gall doesn't hurt the tree by the folks at the local nursery but it sure looked bad.  It was like the tree had a disease.The Bayer Tree and Shrub Protect and Feed Concentrate was recommended by this same nursery. I purchased it and applied it exactly per instruction on the container. It is a systemic product so it takes a while to be absorbed into the tree. We treated our tree in the late fall of 2012. When spring sprung and the leaves emerged the hackberry nipple gall was a no issue.  I would estimate the gall was reduced by 95% and this is with only one treatment.I will treat the tree again this fall as I did last fall and expect there will be no infestation of the dreaded hackberry nipple gall.This is the only tree I've treated with this product. My first purchase of this product was at the nursery and have switched to Amazon.com because of better pricing.August 2014.I'm still happy with this product. Since treating my hackberry tree, which is doing just fine with zero sign of the nipple gall, I've also treated some of my ash trees that became infested with leaf curling aphids. Once again it took a while for the product to be absorbed into the tree but once it got there the aphids just disappeared. Took about 4 weeks.I have also started applying this product to my trees in the early spring versus late fall. My wife read the label and I was reprogrammed...

insects,Chimique,B001D1H6SE,Jose Hernandez,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021","We recently planted a couple of grape vines in our Tucson, Arizona backyard and after a few weeks noticed that some of the leaves were starting to get eaten by tiny, 1/8"" long, yellow and black striped caterpillars.  These things were eating the leaves from the bottom side up.  I looked on Amazon and immediately found this Bonide brand Thuricide-based product and bought it hoping it would work.It most certainly worked!  It took two applications over a period of two days, following the instructions, and, most importantly -- making sure to spray UNDER THE LEAVES directly on the pests.  After two days they were 100 percent dead, as in completely dried up and turned into little shriveled up caterpillar skeletons.  After the first day there were still maybe 30% still alive, but I attribute that to the initial, too-quick, application I did on the leaves.  However, after spraying the product on the leaves the second day, and making sure I sprayed under all the leaves, that ended up ensuring they were all dead by the third day.It does smell a little funny, but that's OK.  It stains, but seems to wash off without any problems and is not permanent.  The reason I downgraded it one star was, as others have noted, is that it only contains 15% Thuricide.  In my case, and since I don't anticipate using it too many times again (I hope), it doesn't matter because it's more than enough to last me a few years.  But if you're going to be using it a lot/very often, or have a lot of plants you need to treat, then I suggest you buy something else that has a higher concentration of the active ingredient.  I've seen on Amazon that there are a number of choices with a more than 80% concentration.  They're more expensive, but in the long run a better buy.But if you're looking for something cheap, easy to use, and you don't need a lot, then this Bonide brand Thuricide is a good buy.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Last year, worms got to the zucchini and I lost it halfway through the season.  That would've been the case again this year, until I heard about Thuricide.  Since I don't need much, I mixed 1/2 tsp. in a spray bottle with 1 quart of water.  I spray it on my zucchini, tomato, collard, and kale plants about once a week at dusk, and also the night after it rains, as the rain washes away the Thuricide.  The first time I used it, I was amazed to see the black worms jump off the plant and onto the dirt!  They were NOT happy.  Since I don't need even the reduced quart of Thuricide mix, I unscrew the sprayer and pour the remaining amount on the zucchini plant itself to ensure it's well treated. As a result, while the main stem of my zucchini plant does not look good at all, the plant keeps on producing zucchinis.  If I fall down on the job, the worms come back and I'll lose a couple baby zucchinis, but the plant recovers and keeps on going.  Those zucchinis must have lots of anti-oxidants!

insects,Chimique,B001D1H6SE,Dorsetgal,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2013","Having recently moved from CA to TX, we were unsure of the pests in our greenhouse garden this season. Most deadly were the Tomato Hornworm. They took over and moved in big-time on our canning type tomatoes and pepper crop. I tired of picking each one off, so I tried Bonide Products 803 Thuricide BT insect killer. When you spray this bacteria onto the plant, it makes the leaves and stems deadly to the pest consuming them. Label indicates within 3 days the worms will be dead. Within 24 hours the brilliantly colored green hornworms turned brown/black and died on the plants. Works beautifully! Will use this product earlier in the season next year so the worms don't get a foothold on the crop. Highly recommend this product to all with worms taking over their garden.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

insects,Chimique,B0CCYD7ZF3,Sallee,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2023","It worked ok to get bugs off my roses. But when I tried it on other flowering plants (bacopa for instance) that had whiteflies it worked very poorly although label says it kills whiteflies. Even daily spraying didn't help. They claim it is also systemic - well I saw no evidence of that over several weeks because the whiteflies were just fine. I finally used Bonide's indoor houseplant systemic granules for insects and even though this flowering plant was outdoors in a pot, that worked although it took a few days. So while Rose Shield may be systemic for its fungicide I don't think it is for bugs since on other plants I tried literally for weeks, daily, to kill those whiteflies and they just kept coming. I could get the backs of leaves to be clear of all whiteflies while spraying but they came right back so I don't think it was due to eggs hatching. I think it just doesn't work as systemic for bugs. Or possibly it absorbs so slowly that your plant will be half-dead before it works. Next year I am going to start with Neem Oil, which works very slowly but if you start before the whiteflies show up it apparently works very well to keep them off your plants, according to what I have read.",3.0 out of 5 stars,

insects,Chimique,B0CCYD7ZF3,amandapanda,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2022","Do your research. Research the top ingredients of this product.Difenoconazole and Thiamethoxam appear to make spider mite infestations worsen, and speed up their reproduction.I can say from experience this is a fact.I purchased this as an effort to find a systemic that will work on Spider Mites, as I had a few houseplants that had very mild infestations (maybe one or two mites per leaf, no webbing etc)After using this product, the mites exploded and tripled. I resorted to using MiteX, which in the past would wipe out the mites quickly. They returned with a vengeance, and the MiteX did absolutely nothing. I then used Captain Jacks Deadbug brew, and the mites keep coming back next day, no matter how much I treat.Stupidly, I thought maybe I didnt apply enough of the Rose Shield. So I did a second application a few weeks later.Again, the spider mites came back, FAST, and MANY. Almost immediately after that second application.After doing some research, I found that the top ingredients in this product actually are known to worsen spider mite infestations.... so why on EARTH is Bonide listing Spider Mites as a controlled pest.I contacted Bonide for help with this.They had stated that the reason why this product didnt work is because I used it on houseplants. This is BS. They said the spider mites that I have on my houseplants must be different than the spider mites outdoors. Which again, BS. I have identified the mites Im battling as two-spotted and red mites, which are common to infect outdoor plants as well as houseplants.They seemed more concerned about me using this product on houseplants. I figured since the bottle said that the area was safe to inhabit once the spray was dry, meant that it would be okay on houseplants as long as you weren't spraying them inside. But apparently not, apparently co-existing with plants indoors that were previously treated with this chemical is very dangerous to you and your pets health. I understand that houseplants werent listed on the label. But a lot of houseplants are considered ornamentals, which are listed on the label.So 3 reasons I cant recommend this product:-It doesnt work as described-It seems to be more dangerous of a chemical than the label makes it seem-Poor customer service",1.0 out of 5 stars,

You will need to pull back on the stop before you can move the sprayer (I found this a little hard but pulled back as far as I could then used a small straight screwdriver to pull back the rest).  I was careful in connecting the hose and did not tighten it too tightly.  And walla it worked the sprayer worked beautifully.  The rose bush is covered and it was easy.  In detaching it I used the same gentle manner.  I turned the sprayer to the stop position and replaced the stop.  I did not encounter leaking or broken attachments.

insects,Chimique,B0053S5ATU,Ronni,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2018","I just assumed that as this is a granular product that it was meant to be activated by rainfall and actually laid this out as it was drizzling outside. I only checked after it had turned into a downpour that it wasn't meant to be laid down that way so I was very worried that I did this all for nothing. Additionally, based on the reviews it seemed that I was putting this down way too late (September 20th). Well all I knew was I had very small grubs infesting my entire lawn and that we were expecting more warm weather (daytime weather between 70-80s, nights in the 60s). So I took my chances. Today September 26th I checked the soil. The grubs are all dead with just a few stragglers struggling to move. When exposed to air they just seem to stretch a bit like I disturbed their sleep and then won't burrow down like they normally did. This is very unlike they were before I laid down the Merit, so it is clearly working and working great. I'm very impressed with this product and am leaving this review in case it can help someone else. Thank you!Here we are now in May of 2019 and I just wanted to add a few details. The entire insect life was completely eradicated by this product. I would like to say that I still would have used this product because I live at a NJ home that didn't receive any lawn care for probably 30 years. Lifting just one paver on my lawn would expose about 30 grubs, so I literally felt that I was at ground zero for the Japanese beetle problem. I had skunks, an army of birds, opposums, racoons, you name it digging up my lawn at all hours of the day and night. Now however I am trying to make the soil healthy and know this is unnatural and not good, not to have a single earthworm etc. left over. I can't say with absolute certainty that it was the Merit, it could be that the Tenacity weed killer I've used also contributed to this but be aware that this is a very strong product.  Once you get your problem under control or you only have a minor problem, I would choose a product that is less harmful to all the other insects and bees as those bugs are very important to your soil health and if you are growing flowers and/or have a garden.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

This year I decided to try Merit, and there was 0 visible grub damage! ...Until just a few days ago.Here is my experience:I applied Merit in early may and successfully avoided the damage that I normally see towards the end of may/early june.I had an average amount of rain for the first 2 weeks of June, and all was well.However, the last 2 weeks of June had unusually heavy rain (bad enough that it caused lawn flooding).After the rain, I had 4 days of no rain.Sadly, now I see lots of fresh grub damage.I don't want to wait for a second delivery, so I purchased some grub killer at the local big box store and hopefully that + the residual merit will be enough to fend them off for the rest of the summer.I'm definitely going to buy this again next year, but I might buy 2 bags so I'm ready to re-apply in case it we get the same crazy amount of rain.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Merit fixed that. Then moving into a new home the lawn was green, but I started feeling soft areas in the lawn that were not there when I cut the grass a few times. There were also raised trails and a large patch of soft grass. I learned that I had moles! Moles eat grubs. Merit kills grubs (and other insects you may or may not want). Grubs and moles are now gone!I read reviews claiming Merit didn't work for them. I call that a likely user error. YOU MUST apply Merit at the appropriate time. If you don't, it will not work, or not work as well as it can. It's up to the user to do their homework because every environment/location is different. Watch the weather so you don't end up with it washed away because of too much rainfall. Most importantly, timing matters. You can't get rid of grubs if you apply Merit, or any other product at the wrong time. Don't expect results that you think should work if YOU apply it at the wrong time.

insects,Chimique,B000BPD9M0,Tim B,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2023","I'll start by saying the reason I do not like using this product is because it can be harmful to beneficial insects like bees and lady bugs.  I try to limit usage to target grubs and plants that are infested with bugs like aphids  when less aggressive treatments don't seem to work.I initially found out about the active ingredient Imidacloprid when researching how to fix issues with grubs ruining the lawn.  That's when I learned the plants will absorb imidacloprid and will kill the insects when they eat the plant.  Imidacloprid seemed to work great at eradicating grubs from my lawn.I picked up this bottle of liquid concentrate for its low price and to use with both 1 gallon pump type sprayer and also hose end sprayer.  My lawn is only around 1,000sf so I dont really need alot of this stuff.  I already have a bunch of old hose end sprayer bottles from other lawn care products so I didn't need another spray bottle.  To spray the lawn for things like ants I'll just add a few ounces to an old spray bottle, I'll use a bottle that was labeled to have the same coverage rate, which would be 32oz for around 5,000sf.  For my 1 gallon pump sprayer I'll mix the labeled rate of 1/2oz per gallon.For grubs in the ground I'll mix up the recommended rate on the professional type products, which would be 15oz of this product per gallon of water which will cover 1,000sf.  I'll walk around and spray the lawn using the pump type sprayer and then go back and water it in.  I'll do this around the end of June.  I'll do this just for grubs, everything else I use the rates listed on the bottle.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

All of that, even after using the exotic stuff found in pricier scientific concentration quantities at stores like A_way. While over 95% of brand labels don't even mention cluster flies.Well this season, with this stuff, I may have found the solution. First warm day I saw flies basking on side of house, I simply made a batch of this stuff and sprayed off the first 80 or so from the side of the house. And then --- MOST importantly I double sprayed the ground beneath that morning sun side of the house.With cluster flies this is the secret. The treatment must already be in place on the ground where and when the larvae TRANSITION into adults.The WHEN (which day and time) is going to be the first warm (over 64F) sunny MORNING after snow has melted. In past years I did not think a weeks wait mattered. This year I ordered early to be ready for the first signs of that chrysalis day or whatever they call it.I swear.

insects,Chimique,B000BPD9M0,The All-Seeing I,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2021","This is a highly effective and economical insect killer. As always, mid-July brought the leaf-eating bugs -- including Japanese Beetles -- and for the cost of a couple bags of chips, this insecticide exterminated everything.It attaches to the hose and creates a leak-less seal, then shoots from its nozzle colorless, clear, and scentless, and with ample pressure and distance. Then it just keeps on coming: While it may ludicrously overstate its coverage at 5000+ square feet, it still exceeded my own non-measured, common sense expectations, adding to its great economy. Bugs went belly-up all over our patio, and with no negative impact on plant foliage.Apply in the morning so it can dissipate throughout the day, and keep pets indoors for as long as you possibly can, as this is a purely chemical concoction.

It was pretty much the only info on treating root aphids successfully and quickly anyway. Peroxide didn't do anything and neem oil wasn't working (at least not fast enough). I was super nervous to try this on my house plants because I own well over 30 of them and didn't find much on it not harming plants, but decided to try it anyway. My plants were no longer thriving because of root aphids and about 15 plants were already infested on my window sill. I couldn't bring myself to get rid of any of them.I used the recommended dose for each gallon and watered my infected house plants with this stuff. I haven't seen any of the bugs crawling around on my sill or under my pots. And there's no longer any fungus gnats anywhere. Not even on the plants I didn't treat yet. I also have been spraying neem oil and have yellow sticky traps out to be safe,  but this is what killed them all off instantly. All of my plants I've treated so far remain undamaged and don't seem to be too stressed. It's only been about 5 days, but if it changes, I'll update my review.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

insects,Chimique,B000BPD9M0,Mom2my6pack,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2015","Works awesome for mosquito and wood ticks in the upper midwest.  As some have ""complained"", you do need to reapply every 4-6 weeks, which in my opinion is simply common sense, its not going to last forever during rain and new grass growth etc.  2-3 applications every summer and you see significantly less mosquitoes and wood ticks every time within 24 hours.  Simply reapply every 4-6 weeks when you see the mosquito population hatching again. You will actually be able to enjoy your shady areas during the day in the summer without being eaten alive.  We just moved to a new home with lots of ""old growth"" that has been undisturbed for years that allowed the wood ticks to grow out of control.  Our 6 children were each picking multiple wood ticks off every day, within 24 hours of spraying, and now over the last week, we have seen 1 single wood tick, not the dozens we were seeing prior and no mosquitoes.

fungi,Chimique,B000UGQ4MW,Robert Crandall,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2015",I have a few hundred Fruit trees in my orchard and have never had trouble with mice and voles girdling the trunks before. The last two winters have been the coldest on record and I had 10 trees stripped right down to bare wood. I was able to successfully 'Bridge' Graft 4 of them and start new grafts on the rest. However I needed something to keep it from happening again. The University recommended adding copper to the white Latex paint that I use to protect from sunscald. When I received the Liquid-Cop there was nothing on the label about this so I contacted the company. They had never heard of using it in this manner. I contacted some of the bigger orchards and the university and it seems a good amount is the maximum use called on the label which is 4 Tablespoons per Gallon along with a cup of pine pitch which I have plenty of. This way I will get two benefits from one process. My wife and I paint in the spring but will now switch to the fall. this will keep the critters from chewing and protect from sunscald in the spring.I also have leaf shot so I sprayed for that about 2 weeks ago. All of the new growth is clean and shot-free. I may still use the lime-sulfur for the tougher issues like Black Knot on Plum trees but this is safe to use on apricots so it will be my main fungus treatment from now on.I was using a Lime Sulphur mix for fungus in my orchard. I received a notice not to use it on Apricots as it can kill them.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

fungi,Chimique,B001H1LNZM,Paul P,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2013","I tried this product 2 years in a row, but it's failed me both times on my primarily tall fescue lawn.  I applied it in May 1 and June 1 both years only to see massive death to my lawn due to some kind of leaf spotting or fusarium blight, and i'm pretty sure a Pythium disease in some areas.  After having another recurrence starting this year, i did a lot of research and found that the active ingredient in Bayer (propiconazole)  is not that highly rated for those types of fungi. Thiophanate-methyl (which is actually found in the Scott's fungus control granules) is better rated, and for Pythium, you have to go with some heavy duty stuff not found at your Home Depot (but other places like do my own pest control dot com do have).  If you're having issues, search out NC State's Turf Files website. There's a ton of great info there.In any case, when i saw fungus starting up again in my yard this june, i bought a product called ""Heritage"" and coupled that with the Scotts product, and within a few days, the fungus started to retreat and the yard was recovering. I did a second application 2 weeks later and its under control. the areas that died didn't come back, but the grass that started to brown has recovered thankfully and it's not spreading like it did last year.the other thing to keep in mind when dealing with fungicides is that you can't use the same one too often or the fungus will build a tolerance to it, so it's good to find a couple different classes of products and rotate them.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I find that using this product with the second and third round of fertilizer spreading, in June and July, leaves my lawn free of the orange/yellow grass blades that occur from fungus growth after nitrogen fertilizer is spread. Don't make the mistake of over-watering the fungus areas, which many people do because it looks like the grass needs more water. It doesn't, and excess water actually aids the fungal growth. I use the same spreader that I use with the granular fertilizer and I do it immediately after spreading the fertilizer. Note that the granules of this product are quite light and will spread unevenly when the wind is blowing. Avoid that and apply when the wind calms down. Water the fertilizer and fungus control well after applying, then go back to your normal watering schedule.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

fungi,Organic,B00D8NQ26C,W. Wright,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2023","I've been using this (concentrate) for a while now.  This small amount goes a long way however.  You need to dilute it well, and put it in to a regular spray bottle, so that you can spray leaves on plants.  My plants in particular are Lantana's.  There is a moth that lays eggs on the Lantana, and when they hatch, then they becomes small worms which will eat all of the young (new) growth on a Lantana bush.  However, if you use this sparingly (dilute it well), and spray the top side and bottom side of all Lantana bush leaves, then it will discourage (or kill entirely) the stupid bugs that eat my plants.  I have been using this concentrate for years with great success.  You might want to wear gloves when applying it, because the mixture is very toxic (kind of) and will stay on your skin for a long time and is hard to get off, when you are spraying plants.

fungi,Organic,B00D8NQ26C,J. Davis,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2015","I wasted the whole growing season having false faith in this product that was recommended by the local nursery. From what I can tell on other reviews it seems people are just as pleased as can be.  I seem to be the only person alive that has fungus, disease, insects, mites, you name it, all over my veggies. If this product did just one of the many things it promises I would at least have one veggie left. But this product did nothing for my aphids, in fact, it seemed to fire them up to eat more. Powdery mildew was on one maybe two leaves of my cucumber when I sprayed as directed, it acted more like a plague distributor as now there is powdery mildew everywhere despite my di!igent temp checks and humidity monitoring and following application instructions to a t. Yes I got top and bottom of each leaf, I got stems, I got new growth, I got the soil, instead of gaining some kind of control, the fungus took over within a week and aside from letting my plant slowly get sucked dry I am tempted to burn it all down. Then I got aphids on my lettuce and they were literally covering the entire plant. I doused it with fertilome and there was nary a single death. It almost seemed they were raising their tiny glasses and cheering me. Next came spider mites on my greenbeans.  This product had no effect. None. This magical potion promises so much. And I have so much I need taken care of. Out of all the insects, diseases, funguses, and mites its supposed to eradicate, is it too much to ask to get just one thing?  Just one?  But no, for me the magic has worn off and all I am left with is putrid smelling worthlessness - although I may have lung cancer in my near future so there's that.  Oh ya and my millions upon millions of new disgusting life destroying scurg of the earth. And just so you know, I have a greenhouse that has a water drip system on a timer, the temperature is regulated morning and night, sterilized soil and vermiculite with monthly fertilization with granular fertilizer along with calcium and phosphates for the tomatoes all are provided via product instructions.  I wanted it to work. I really truly did. I gave it many chances to do something . . anything . . . entire growing season.  . . It simply does not work. Just doesn't.

That is how bad it was.  So I got this spray after reviewing possible ideas and totally sprayed all the leaves top and bottom.  After 7 to 10 days I came back with the idea I might spray again to help the poor tree along.  But what I saw was shocking.  ALL the black and brown shrivel was TOTALLY gone.  The tree looked healthy and so did EVERY leaf on the tree.  Literally there was not one dark spot or sick leaf.  The entire tree looked vibrant.  Just so you know, there were no leaves on the ground so the did not dry up and fall off.  Somehow they got cured.  So now I spray it once every 3 weeks and the tree is a model of perfect health.

fungi,Organic,B000UJVDXY,Jodie,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023","I purchased this Copper Fungicide spray to treat various succulents (including Jade plants) that had white mold & black spots. First, I cut off affected leaves, then copiously sprayed each plant, covering every portion, every 5 days for months. I continued to cut affected leaves & repeated the process until the mold/spots resolved. Some plants were nearly bald but the leaves have grown back & my plants are healthy. After months of treatments, I wiped each and every plant (leaves, branches, etc.) with alcohol pads to clean off any remaining debris, then rinsed each plant with water. This product saved my plants. It took a lot of time, patience and effort, but it worked. I highly recommend this fungicidal spray. You must be patient and willing to take time to save your plants.

I wasn’t expecting it to cure already existing fungal disease, but I was hoping it would help stop the spread fairly quickly and I could prune the sick areas and hopefully eventually it would grow new and flourish again. This is slightly the case but it’s not the best. It takes awhile to see any difference in terms of slowing any spreading and even then I still see infection continuously growing and not stopping the spread.

I called the company and they sent me a new one one time, but said to make sure and shake it well before using it.If you look at the picture you see that it separates into a milky white substance and an oily yellow substance that floats on top - they don't really mix well, even after shaking. There's also some white particulate matter that wouldn't go through the spray head, so I finally bought a battery powered sprayer and strained the stuff before putting it in the sprayer and everything was working well, but 32 oz doesn't go far so I ordered the gallon.That was another fiasco. The cap doesn't unscrew so I couldn't pour it into my sprayer, so I thout I'd try the attached spray head.

But, they can be difficult to nurture because of the fungi (Black Spot Disease) that loves them, too.  Unfortunately, I hate mixing and spraying fungicides and consequently, I'm just not inclined to use them.This summer I had an opportunity to use Garden Safe Fungicide3.  I found it very easy to use...It comes premixed so you just shake it up a little and spray the roses with the built in, hand pump, sprayer.  It takes about ten minutes to treat a medium to large rose and about five minutes for a small one.I found the fragrance pleasantly citrusy.  The hand sprayer can cause a bit of muscle fatigue in the forearms, but provides an even, fine spray that covered the cane and leaves quite thoroughly.  After using it twice this summer on two and once on one of my four of my remaining roses, all the new growth is completely disease free.  Keep in mind, this product will not rehabilitate already infected leaves, but it will allow new growth to flourish.

It attacks multiple problems in a single spray: fungus, insects, and mites.  This large bottle replaces all the small, ready-to-use bottles I usually keep in my garage.  I find it especially useful on my tomato plants which tend to get whiteflies and fungal disease near the end of the summer when humidity is high.  This spray doesn't get everything, but it tamps down problems enough for the plants to thrive.You must remove the cap and insert the hose end fully in the opening.  Once the hose is extended, the trigger pumps effortlessly.  I love that I can usually leave the bottle on the ground while using the hose,  The only time I need to pick it up is when I need to reach the tops of my tomato plants.  For beans, peppers, and eggplants, I just leave it on the ground.  I always make sure that I use it in the evening when bee activity is at a minimum.  I don't want to wipe out the pollinators with the thrips, mites, aphids, and whiteflies.  Note:  this doesn't address destructive pests in worm form.Finding this Garden Safe Fungicide3 in a large, ready-to-use jug is a thrill.  While that might sound like hyperbole, it's not.  I go through small bottle after small bottle throughout the summer, and this is much more convenient.  Plus, it sprays better.

fungi,Organic,B000HHO110,Lokiamus,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2022","Finished up my last bottle of organic spray and decided to try Fungicide 3 for the first time for possible better results. In comparing ingredients with my old spray bottle, I did noticed both are 3-in-1 products with the same “active ingredients” list. Both list Neem oil at 0.9% and “other ingredients” at 99.1% which basically told me nothing. What I did discover is Fungicide 3 is effective on controlling and stopping powdery mildew and the few aphids tested on. I had a zucchetta & delicata squash both showing early signs of powdery mildew where I removed a couple of bad leaves, sprayed, repeat and waited. The spray was great at controlling the spread and the plants cleared up nicely without a reoccurrence.  I guess you could say ‘I dodged that bullet’ catching it early on. As a insecticide, I can’t really give it high marks. I usually let the lacewings and ladybugs do their thing on the aphids, but decided to test the spray on one plant for effectiveness and it did work! The big test was spraying direct onto the various nymphs, larvae and other pests that were thriving on my veggies and it did not work. They were maybe stunned for a couple of seconds then continued on with their activities. Overall, I think this is a good and effective 3-in-1 spray for powdery mildew on squash plants. It also works on insects & infestations included on their product list, but anything not listed will probably be hit-and-miss. If you have a pollinator garden, you will still need to confine your spraying to early morning or late evening outside of bee working hours (“This product is toxic to bees exposed to direct treatment”) & avoid spraying plants that butterflies and caterpillars feed on (especially milkweed if you’re helping monarchs). For me, this is a powerful powdery mildew eliminator and definitely will consider the larger bottle concentration for attaching my water hose. As an insecticide I’ll have to wait and see what next spring brings.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Noticing that the plant was struggling, we used online gardeners to identify the  problems and used several natural methods for some weeks with a small degree of success. The powdery mildew seemed to abate but the aphids returned - so many that that every flower bud fell as soon as it appeared and leaves were dropping fast. Worried that our other plants would be affected and to save the tree, we finally purchased the Garden Safe Fungicide as a last resort. We'd heard the good and bad about Neem Oil and decided to use it in moderation and with care.There was a quick and obvious improvement that we monitored and treated as necessary over the following weeks.

fungi,Organic,B000HHO110,G. D. Golden,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2021","This product is advertised as effective against aphids, but as far as I am able to tell, it seems to have almost no effect on their behavior.I have a small indoor brussel sprout plant which has a minor infestation of grey cabbage aphids. Application of the product in accordance with the instructions has had little effect on the aphid population over more than a week.Groups of aphids do not react to it in any obvious way when sprayed directly. They do not move away from it, nor do they seem to avoid areas where it was sprayed, nor do they appear to vacate the general area in which it was applied, even after saturating the area (per the instructions). Even several days after the application, there seems to be little difference in the overall density or behavior of  the aphids over the full plant.  Examination of groups of aphids in sprayed areas with a hand magnifier shows that some  aphids have indeed stopped moving, presumably having died in place, but quite a few are still obviously alive and moving, and as far as I can tell using the magnifier, still happily feeding on the surfaces of the leaves.In short, it seems to have little more effect than a spray of plain water to just wash them off.  I emphasize that I carefully read the instructions and applied the product accordingly: Shaken vigorously before use, applied in a saturating manner (""until run off"") to all leaves.I haven't tried it in any situation other than the one described above, so perhaps it is effective against other pests in other contexts, but it surely is not a useful product against cabbage aphids.I fell back on my previous technique which was just to brush the aphids off the leaves using a soft-bristled paintbrush.

But I had these ugly mushrooms in my house plant and I wanted to give anything a try that might work. And to my  delight this worked after only three treatments.I think the key might be in the process. I made sure to remove all of the mushroom caps first and then sprayed the small fungal growth that was at the base of the mushrooms. After the first treatment, there was some continued growth and I was a little worried that the product might not work. But after two more treatments, I've had no more mushroom growth in my plant.Give it a try, if you have those somewhat fluorescent, yellow green mushrooms and then this should work for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I dug them up and found them under rocks, lumber, and even in the seams of the concrete!I ordered the product after doing some research on how to get rid of the mushrooms.  The first time I sprayed, it didn't seem to work, so I dug up the mushrooms again and flooded the area along the fence with the spray.  The directions say to use every two weeks.  Sure enough, two weeks to the day, the mushrooms were back, but not nearly as bad.  Some areas had no mushrooms at all and they weren't busting through the fences as they were before.  I did have new areas with mushrooms so once again, I flooded the areas, but I felt I was winning the battle.I have a week left before I'm supposed to spray again, so I'm hoping they won't be back.  Also this area is not where our dogs go.  On the area where there were mushrooms and our dogs would likely walk on, I flooded it with the spray and put lawn furniture over it.

fungi,Chimique,B0035KNZJU,Cowboy,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2022","For the past several years my lawn has developed a summertime fungus.  It is almost like clockwork around late-June when I noticed small patches of white fluff, almost like cobwebs, in the morning on the dew covered lawn.  These spots quickly turned white and then died, and this spread rapidly around the yard creating small circular dead spots that would often merge together.  It was hideous, especially for someone with lawn OCD.  I haven't officially identified the fungus but have narrowed it down the likely culprits to dollar spot or brown patch.  So here comes the remedy...This BioAdvanced spray works wonders and stops the growth and spread of this fungus, when caught early enough in the process.  It seems to work more quickly and effectively than the Scotts DiseaseEx that I tried in other areas of the lawn.  However you will blow through this bottle very quickly and there is no way this will cover the 5,000 square feet as advertised.  I probably had my bottle emptied within two minutes and maybe covered 1,000 square feet.  You definitely want to be prepared to hustle and have your hose spread out in advance to maximize your application.  You will probably need three bottles of this for an average size lawn.

fungi,Chimique,B0035KNZJU,Anchorman-CET,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2023","Update 2023.07.27 -- The manufacturer provided a refund. Good for them; but what about the faulty nozzle? I had one unused bottle left (from an earlier purchase) with the new style spray nozzle. I decided to do an experiment. I place a hose on/off value between the end of the hose and the bottle. I left the spray nozzle open. I controlled the spraying with the on/off value that I added. The bottle of product worked perfectly. I could start and stop spraying with no problem. So then I decided to control the spraying by the nozzle's actual on/off switch. As soon as I turned the nozzle's switch to the off position the bottle ballooned outward and I could see that the bottle had filled itself up with water, thus diluting the product.In short, the new style spray nozzle does not work for me. I must control the spray on/off by some other means.Manufacturer, I do not want another refund. Rather, I am very curious whether this problem is specific to the water pressure (or something else) at my home or is this a widespread problem. If wide spread, when are you going to fix it or go back to the old nozzle style which worked great?Original ----------I have used this product for years. No complaints. I buy 3-4 bottles at a time. I liked it so much recently started a subscribe & save. However, I could not effectively use the last batch of bottles. In each case the bottle seemed to be working until I realized#1) that the shape of the bottle had ballooned outward due to inside pressure.#2) the fluid level in the bottle had gone up rather than down.#3) the fluid was so diluted that it was nearly clear and could not be seen on the bottle's gauge.In summary, the water from my hose was going into the bottle diluting the product and causing the bottle to expand.Now as to why. I am not certain; but I observed three things.#1) the spray nozzle had changed designs.#2) the straw in the bottle to suck up the product has a smaller diameter when compared to bottles I previously bought. Yes, I sometimes save empty spray bottles.#3) I turned my faucet down to about half flow, reducing the pressure coming out of the hose. This worked. The product drained from the bottle as it should *until* I turned the spray nozzle off so as to move to another section of lawn. Once moved and ready to start again, I saw that the bottle was now full and ballooned outward. The rest of the product was diluted so as to be ineffective.This problem cost me to waste 3 bottles of the product. To save the contents of the fourth bottle I poured into the old bottle I had saved. It had a much larger straw and an older style nozzle. I started spraying. NO PROBLEMS. I turned the faucet back to full flow. I continued spraying. NO PROBLEMS.In short, the manufacturer has screwed up the bottle's sprayer. This error has cost me 3 wasted bottles.I hope the manufacturer reads this post.

The instructions do say it will empty the bottle in 5-6 minutes but this is much faster than any other ready to spray product I have used.  The general assumption that you need to at least lightly wet the area being sprayed must be incorrect.  In general I walk fast, but one bottle emptied in less than 2500 sq ft.  Maybe if you have a large area with no obstacles, curves or discontinuous areas and walk very fast you could get the 5000 sq ft coverage.  If you need to stop spraying to move to another area or move the hose, etc.  too much is wasted just trying to shut off the spray with the built in control since it will lock in the ON position too.

fungi,Chimique,B0035KNZJU,Joe,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2018","I'm a new homeowner and I started seeing brown patches on my once beautiful lawn that resembled photos I looked up for brown patch.  So I decided to give this a try.The first problem is that when hooked up to the hose, it doesn't take long to deplete the entire bottle and I wasn't able to cover the entire area that I needed.  It might've stopped the fungus from spreading but because I didn't see any improvement after applying, I thought maybe I misdiagnosed the problem and maybe the areas were dying from lack of water.  The photo I attached is the before but it could also be used as the after.  There were other areas also, but this was the worst.It wasn't until over a month later it started to spread again.  I tried another bottle, and even though I knew it applied very quickly, I still wasn't able to cover the entire area.  I saw no signs of improvement, and the fungus continued spreading very quickly.So I gave up on the Bayer Advanced and tried concentrated Eagle20EW.  I liked this much better because I was able to dilute it and control the application rate much better.  Within about a week I saw most of my grass starting to turn green again.  I wish I used the Eagle sooner because the areas I initially applied the Bayer Advanced were too far gone at that point to be revived and they needed to be re-seeded.  So I would definitely not go back to the Bayer Advanced, which happens to be much more expensive per application and nowhere near as effective.  Just beware that the Eagle 20EW is more of a commercial grade product and you should take extra precautions (wear gloves and eye protection, dilute properly).

fungi,Chimique,B06ZYC7SX5,Joseph Duncan,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2022","Long time grower here. I recently got infested with russet mites in my garden. If you think spider mites are bad, russet mites make them look like family pets. Within a week of me noticing the damage (yellow, shriveled leaves and brownish buds) my entire grow was infested. I had some Monterey Garden Insect Spray  on hand. Its active ingredient is spinosad, a non-toxic bacterial byproduct that usually works on spider mites. I tried that, and although it helped, it was only slowing them down. So I went online and did some research and came up with two names: Humboldts Flower Shield and Trifecta Crop Control. Since Flower Shield was cheaper, and had a recognizable company name, I went with that.Oh, boy, big mistake. Not only did this product NOT do as it claims, which is kill russet mites, it also left a sticky residue on my buds. The residue is so tacky I was having trouble harvesting and trimming my plants. It also caused the outer layer of the buds to turn an unattractive orange-brown color, like they were burned or something. So I thoroughly washed my buds before hanging them up to dry, hoping that would remove the residue.Fast forward one week, and upon smoking my buds I was assaulted by a horrible soap-in-the-mouth and something unidentifiable flavor. I suppose I will have to toss this entire batch of bud and start over. Even though some of my buds escaped the wrath of the russet mites, Humboldts Secret Flower Shield made sure that what I managed to save was thoroughly ruined and unsmokable. They claim their product is non-toxic. But then they also claim it kills mites and would not leave a residue... so... yeah.If there is a silver lining to my tale of woe, it is that I finally did purchase the Trifecta Crop Control. It is ridiculously expensive, but it has brought my russet mite infestation under control, and does not appear to leave a sticky residue on anything. The only caveat being, it is rough on the leaves and will burn them if you do not follow instruction to a tee.In summary, stay far far away from this product. Get Trifecta Crop Control instead. Or just nuke your whole grow and start over from scratch if you get russet mites.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

fungi,Chimique,B06ZYC7SX5,C. Williams,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2018","This product performs exactly as it says on everything it says it will...I have been gardening and breeding specific plants many years now and specifically medically the past half dozen years and the results get tested after harvest and I trust this product to do what it says while still allowing me to provide clean medicine to my patients and myself. Use it at the full recommended 2oz /gal to knock down the bugs/mites (Foliar spray and/or drench/dunk depending on where the pest lives) and 1oz/gal to knock down any of the PM or other fungi (non pest/insect uses)...INITIALLY, then after the first dose you should be able to cut it in half for the next couple treatments and then in half again for any follow up...It may not be cheap but it is economical IMO (mainly because it WORKS, lol) and if you stay on top of your spray schedule depending on what you are treating for then you will not require it for long because, again, IT WORKS! ;) ...if you are treating for mites I would recommend spraying at FULL strength TWO TIMES (3 days apart) using the best sprayer/atomizer you can get and really get in there now! The tops and bottoms of all leaves, the branches & stems and the top of your soil/mulch and even the floor surrounding the plants... I will sometimes add Dr. Bronners clear hemp liquid soap at a T per gal for pest treatments...helps with surface tension and further smothering the little bastards! After treatments and in between I like to spray with clean water and sometimes a foliar additive for vigor or growth like kelp (Golden Tree - Same company as this product), willow bark extract, etc., to help the plant recover from the issue that caused the treatments to begin with.

fungi,Chimique,B071CQ8SDY,Joseph Duncan,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2022","Long time grower here. I recently got infested with russet mites in my garden. If you think spider mites are bad, russet mites make them look like family pets. Within a week of me noticing the damage (yellow, shriveled leaves and brownish buds) my entire grow was infested. I had some Monterey Garden Insect Spray  on hand. Its active ingredient is spinosad, a non-toxic bacterial byproduct that usually works on spider mites. I tried that, and although it helped, it was only slowing them down. So I went online and did some research and came up with two names: Humboldts Flower Shield and Trifecta Crop Control. Since Flower Shield was cheaper, and had a recognizable company name, I went with that.Oh, boy, big mistake. Not only did this product NOT do as it claims, which is kill russet mites, it also left a sticky residue on my buds. The residue is so tacky I was having trouble harvesting and trimming my plants. It also caused the outer layer of the buds to turn an unattractive orange-brown color, like they were burned or something. So I thoroughly washed my buds before hanging them up to dry, hoping that would remove the residue.Fast forward one week, and upon smoking my buds I was assaulted by a horrible soap-in-the-mouth and something unidentifiable flavor. I suppose I will have to toss this entire batch of bud and start over. Even though some of my buds escaped the wrath of the russet mites, Humboldts Secret Flower Shield made sure that what I managed to save was thoroughly ruined and unsmokable. They claim their product is non-toxic. But then they also claim it kills mites and would not leave a residue... so... yeah.If there is a silver lining to my tale of woe, it is that I finally did purchase the Trifecta Crop Control. It is ridiculously expensive, but it has brought my russet mite infestation under control, and does not appear to leave a sticky residue on anything. The only caveat being, it is rough on the leaves and will burn them if you do not follow instruction to a tee.In summary, stay far far away from this product. Get Trifecta Crop Control instead. Or just nuke your whole grow and start over from scratch if you get russet mites.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

fungi,Chimique,B071CQ8SDY,C. Williams,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2018","This product performs exactly as it says on everything it says it will...I have been gardening and breeding specific plants many years now and specifically medically the past half dozen years and the results get tested after harvest and I trust this product to do what it says while still allowing me to provide clean medicine to my patients and myself. Use it at the full recommended 2oz /gal to knock down the bugs/mites (Foliar spray and/or drench/dunk depending on where the pest lives) and 1oz/gal to knock down any of the PM or other fungi (non pest/insect uses)...INITIALLY, then after the first dose you should be able to cut it in half for the next couple treatments and then in half again for any follow up...It may not be cheap but it is economical IMO (mainly because it WORKS, lol) and if you stay on top of your spray schedule depending on what you are treating for then you will not require it for long because, again, IT WORKS! ;) ...if you are treating for mites I would recommend spraying at FULL strength TWO TIMES (3 days apart) using the best sprayer/atomizer you can get and really get in there now! The tops and bottoms of all leaves, the branches & stems and the top of your soil/mulch and even the floor surrounding the plants... I will sometimes add Dr. Bronners clear hemp liquid soap at a T per gal for pest treatments...helps with surface tension and further smothering the little bastards! After treatments and in between I like to spray with clean water and sometimes a foliar additive for vigor or growth like kelp (Golden Tree - Same company as this product), willow bark extract, etc., to help the plant recover from the issue that caused the treatments to begin with.

Since I was not going to need a large amount, I only mixed up 1 cup of water with 1/2 teaspoon of fungicide in a small spray bottle. I carried my plants outside and after spraying the soil, I left them there for an hour to dissipate any lingering vapors. The fungicide does not smell bad, so it is important to maintain good safety procedures.  However, although the fungicide did not affect me, my husband was extremely sensitive to it and I had to banish my plants to the camper for a few days. He had headaches and breathing issues.I shall be giving my peach trees a light spray in a month or so after I have picked all the peaches. Although the trees are Florida-specific varieties, the humidity can get a bit much in summer.It is nice to see an organic product for fungus, as I thought there were no organic solutions for that problem.

The parasites of insect and fungal origin are much higher than before the monstrosity hit.  Having this handy is helpful.HOW THIS COMESThis comes in a nice thick bottle which is opaque.  The top is on tight and not too difficult to use.  The back label peels off so you can read it, but be sure your hands are clean or it won't stick shut again.HOW I USEI use this for now in a two quart spray bottle with 1 tablespoon of liquid mixed with half gallon of water.  I spray it on the plants well and make sure to get top and bottom of the leaves as much as possible.DOES IT WORK?I used it the first time on what I thought was a fungus, but it turns out it was teeny tiny little bugs that I did not realize make it look like fungal infection.  This helped some, but I used my Dr Bronners diluted mix for it instead and it worked better.  For a later development of spots on a few other plants where no bugs were evident, it seems to be giving the plants a good boost and they are looking better.MAKE UP ONLY WHAT YOU NEEDThis needs to be made up with only what you will use at any given time.  It is not supposed to sit around a while.  I have had it sit for a week and used it on a new plant and it seemed okay, but it is not advised.CAN THIS BE USED INDOORS?This can be used both indoors and outdoors.  The instructions are a bit different for each, so be sure to pay attention to that when you use this.  The video shows a different concentration than outdoors.THE BOTTOM LINEI wanted this for my vegetable and flower plants.  I wanted organic.

Honestly, to my complete surprise I noticed a difference after one use and I'm not talking no miracle or anything but this is the first product I've used and was able to notice some result from and I'd used others several times with no difference and continuing to spread. I'm now doing my second spray no new spots or leaves have been infected which I'm so happy about and plants are looking better and now I actually have hope I can save my babies. (Yes I'm the crazy plant lady who loves all my pretty plants) I'm so happy I found this product!

fungi,Chimique,B0052NL4FK,Stoney,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2016","> Great for controlling fungus on fruit trees and vegetables, because copper sulfate in small quantities is not toxic to human beings.  If your fruit or vegetables absorb a little copper, they are perfectly safe to eat.> It actually needs to touch the surface of the plant that is affected---that is, both the top and bottom sides of leaves, and needs to set there for a while.  So, spray from multiple angles, and don't apply unless you expect conditions to be dry for say 6 hours or more.> Can kill or repel snails and slugs, since they are very sensitive to copper.> I mostly spray it on my citrus and mango trees.  For some varieties of mangos it is essential in order for the flowers to set (i.e., develop into fruit).  I also paint undiluted copper sulfate on tree wounds (e.g., such as those caused by trimming a limb).> It is recommended not to use it on orchids or bromeliads---but I've had no choice when I've treated trees which had orchids and bromeliads growing on them--but the orchids and bromeliads seem to tolerate it with no problem.> Copper sulfate mostly works on the surface of the leaves, kills the surficial fungus, and is washed off with the next rain -- very little is absorbed. Copper sulfate is ineffective against (systemic) fungal infections of the stems or roots, since it is NOT absorbed at significant levels.  That means little gets into the fruit or vegetables.> If you have serious fungus problems on non-fruit trees or other ornamentals (such as roses), you may need a systemic fungicide.

This fungicide works well to slow down septoria blight but does not eliminate it.  It allows me to get a crop of tomatoes - without it I would only have blackened plants and a few shriveled fruit.  Many of my neighbors have similar problems and few get much of a tomato crop w/o using copper spray.It's pretty straightforward to use - mix 1/4 cut to 1 gallon of water and apply with a pressure sprayer.  I apply it from the first setting of my plants until mid-August - after that the septoria and the plant duke it out until the first frost.  I use an organic vapor mask while applying - maybe not necessary but I don't like to take chances.I also use it on ornamental plants.  It does a good job suppressing powdery mildew but, again, does not eliminate the disease.  Again, I use it from early in the growing season until mid-August - once the flowering period is over I cut out all infected stems and dispose of them in a separate area (no compost!).This is the most effective product I have found for both septoria and powdery mildew.

Immediately halted the leaf curl, and the new leaves that sprouted after have been perfect.  It has now been over a month and I haven't had to do another treatment.  At first I was worried that this little bottle wouldn't last too long, but you actually fill the sprayer with water and only put a little bit of the bonide.  I made 1.5 gallons the first time (and only used a spoonful of bonide), and covered two trees fully and still had a bunch left in the sprayer.  I read the bottle and it works for some rose diseases, so I went and sprayed those too (and still didn't empty the sprayer).

The local extension office examined it and told us it was a disease that cypress can get and to use a copper fungicide.  First we bought the ready-to-spray type, but it's around $10 a bottle and it takes about a bottle to fully cover a 5-6"" cypress tree.  Then we found this which has to be mixed, but is much more cost effective.  The tree had to be treated every week for a bit, but the copper fungicide stopped the progression of the disease right away.  The continuing treatments have gotten it healed pretty well and kept it from spreading to adjacent cypress.  Overall very pleased with the product.

So together with an out of balance good /damaging bugs, for my gardens there will be fungus. No matter how many steps I take for proper garden practices, not over watering, not wetting foliage, no leaving debris on the ground from trimmed plants etc.Anyway, last year was the first time I used it and it saved my gardens. This year, just as helpful . I really had a difficult time deciding with what type of fungicide to choose from . I was considering the copper one. I'm just glad I went with this. Yesterday, there were signs of blight I could just see it on half of my plants . The pumpkin vine leaves were all droopy and the female buds turned brown and died before opening. I sprayed the vine , and the VERY next day it had perked back up with a green female bud visible.  Same with my annual flowers .I can spray this properly diluted ratio (I go a little under just to be safe) directly on any plant parts and there has been zero foliage burn. I don't have to spray it directly on the flowers, bc I do not want to harm pollinators. However, without this product , there would be zero flowers /plants for any pollinators and my plant therapy would be no more. I am not even being dramatic.This works. It's safe for garden flowers and plants. Does not cause any browning. Simple and effective . Fact. I keep this stocked (although it lasts a long time with one application,  and there are plenty of applications with this concentrate).I use a 32 oz high output regular style spray bottle. This method is certainly less hassle compared with the other styles, excluding mass planting areas. I will include a photo for reference.First picture - this pumpkin would not exist if I hadn't used some spray on the leaves and mainly the female buds that never opened- small, brown/yellow that would shrivel right off. The poor things were just helpless, it seemed nothing could keep them healthy!  However, this product did such,  ridding whatever fungus present. A week or so later, a robust female flower was able to prosper.Second picture - we had a tail end of a hurricane (2017) come through, which ""mashed"" this zinnia to the ground. The area was soggy and humid, yet this fungicide prevented fungal infection. Every orange flower is on this one zinnia. This example is fairly odd and unflattering, yet it demonstrates the effectiveness of this product.Third picture- the type of bottle referenced above.Last: balsam impatient plant, day before & day afterLong review but my passion is this right here, and without this product, in my area I would not have thriving plants.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

fungi,Chimique,B0CDLF88KF,B-Rad,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2013","This product worked as described, but I had a few issues with it.  My main complaint is that I think I waited much too long to use it.  I decided to first try some ""organic' and ""home"" remedies to control the mold issue I was having in and on potted plants on my lanai.  That was my first mistake.  While I was dabbling with White Vinegar, and an assortment of other household chemicals, the mold was destroying my plants.By the time I actually had gotten around to applying this product, the damage was quite extensive.  The product got to work quickly, but most of the damage had been already done.  I mixed the product as described, and immediately noticed a reduction in powdery mildew and mold on the leaves of the plants.  Most of them required a second and third heavier application before seeing the mold eradicated completely.I have a wide variety of flowers and each had a varying reaction to this product.  Most had little to no reaction to it, however, there were a few that were worth noting.  A few of my more delicate orchids definitely had some yellowing of leaves and wilting flowers.  They came back pretty strong.  What was hit most strongly was my Blue Ginger.  I don't think it will ever be coming back.  What the mold didn't kill, the fungicide most definitely did.Overall, I would recommend this product with a few disclaimers.  First, start at the first warning signs of mold or any fungus, whether it is in the soil, on the leaves, or on the stalks.  Second, if using on potted plants, make sure you are mixing the solution exactly.  Too much of this product is not a good thing, it will burn up your delicate plants.  It is much better to mix it too light, and apply it more often.  Mold is resilient!  Third, apply secondary precautions to help the fungicide.  Remove affected plants, if possible, from others as mold will spread, increase air flow, and increase sunlight.  Make sure your potted plants have plenty of drainage!

I decided on this product based upon some research on the internet and decided to give it a try to cure the leaf curl.For starters,  I have sprayed my tree down as I was supposed to in order to avoid this but upon doing some research, the spray I was using wasn't strong enough to use at the end of the season. It was just an organic three in one fungicide, insecticide and miticide,  I found that the product I was using is best just to spray on during the season as opposed to preventing diseases long term. Anyway so I decided on this product.My tree started showing signs about two weeks ago and I tried my original three and one spray which didn't help in the least bit, I would pull the damaged leaves off every day and it showed no signs of stopping or slowing down. I bought this and mixed it in a spray bottle as directed only putting in a little of the fungicide and I added some dish detergent to help it stick to the leaves better.  I sprayed it on the leaves on a warm, sunny day in order to help the drying process and pulled off the rest of the damaged leaves.  Usually if I would pull them all off, I would get at least 4 more the next day.  After using this I had two leaves the next day and then the following day I didn't notice any.  Since I have applied it about a week ago, I have only noticed one other leaf that had it. I'm optimistic that this cured my tree and will be reapplying it at the two week mark just to be extra cautious.

I was also quite nervous about mixing the concoction, especially having to use a pressurized sprayer with such a harsh chemical (very important to make sure it's de-pressurized before opening the lid--you do NOT want this stuff splashing near you).

I have 6 Plumeria plants that are about 6 feet tall, and I started using the immunox at the first sign of rust (about July 4).

Our weather here has been absolutely miserable this spring, and I believe if it weren't for the awful wet spring, this product might have completely eliminated the problem.

It keeps them in check so they don't get out of control but every few days I check my leaves and usually find a live one. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get rid of all the spider mites but this product will keep them in check. Knowing I have to use this product every few days on 12 plants makes this product  quite expensive.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Enjoyed talking to him as he was extremely knowledgeable about what we were doing.

I started spraying this on my roses leaves as soon as they started appearing, as instructed, and all growing season last year I faithfully applied the spray to my rose leaves every other week, as instructed. The photo attached shows that I still, despite consistent application, got spots on my leaves though I will admit the spots weren't as bad as the previous year. I also noticed, but forgot to take a picture of, was that as the season progressed the spots did appear less frequently and I even had a good amount of leaves with no spots, I hesitate to say this product solved the problem. It helped certainly and I'll continue to use it again this upcoming year but it wasn't a miracle product. Maybe I was doing something wrong, I don't know.

BioAdvanced is saving my diseased roses after a black spot riddled spring and summer. Several roses also suffered from mold and this stuff treats that. It’s even restored a climber with sickly pale leaves that no amount of fertilizer could improve. I considered digging up that pitiful rose and am delighted with its healthy green growth. That must’ve been some kind of fungus, too. This product treats multiple diseases and hasn’t harmed my beneficials. Ive tried various organic fungicides religiously for years but none of them worked. Our western Virginia weather is hard on roses and mine were dwindling from losing so many leaves and canes to disease. Now they’re flourishing. BioAdvanced also treats the leaf spot on my phlox, Iris, and day lilies, the rust on hollyhocks, and mildew on bee balm... Next season if I begin spraying in April, I’ll have much happier plants, and I might be able to spray less if I get on top of disease early.

For the roses, I first poured 3 gallons of water into a bucket and then poured in the recommended product carefully (1 1/2 TBSP) for each gallon of water. Then I put on gloves and dipped a regular spray bottle in the bucket to fill it and sprayed each rosebush thoroughly. Problem is, it’s impossible to get every part of the bush this way, and in the end I put quite a bit around the base of the rosebush because I read the product goes through the roots. Directions are vague.It was a heck of a job but I already notice much less mold and rust.

We had a lot of bees on the flowers and did not want to kill them.  This product gets rid of the disease without harming the bees.My only complaint was the shipping fee.

I didn’t realize until after I sprayed my only hemp plant that this product is waterproof. This is also bad for your lungs. If you make the dumb decision I did to spray this on anything you’re planning on smoking, eating or anything, don’t look online or on the site because there’s zero information on how to clean your leaves of this stuff. Luckily it only stays in the plant for two weeks, and I had only 7 weeks left to go to harvest. How to clean your leaves should you make this blunder? Use milk, oil, and hot water. Wet a washcloth and rub the leaves with this solution. You can also use baking soda and water. I cleaned the leaves about three times with this solution, and it was a lot of work. Please read everything and google this product before you buy. I don’t like that it’s waterproof, because if you accidentally get some on the wrong plant, there’s zero information on how to clean the plant. Also I no longer like this brand because it’s not natural and is unsafe to animals and the environment. If you have a cat, don’t use this! Cats sometimes nibble on plants so this can be very toxic. Sorry but I’m sticking to natural for now on. You’re better off just spraying your plants with oil and milk to remove mold and keep away pests. Or baking soda and water.

Landscape guy said it had to be torn out and replaced (for $$$$), and the surrounding ground chemically treated to kill the spores, so I figured I had nothing to lose with trying this stuff.  Doused the bush once a week, and very quickly saw improvement:  New growth popping out (totally fungus-free) and the old, infected leaved being dropped.  After 5 weeks, the laurel looks great, and is even putting out flowers.

fungi,Chimique,B000RUJZS6,Jackie Jade,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2020","This is my first time using a systemic product.  The pros outweigh the cons.  However, I was out of Rose Rx, which I use on everything, and I could get this quicker,  Now I may stay with the systemic. Rose Rx works wonderful but I feel like I have to use it every 1 to 2 days to  manage insects.  I am new to planting flowers and maintaining them.  It's a lot of work and expensive and it's hard to find what really works and on what.  I hope the following details help,.HibiscusThis is my first time using systemic product.  I sprayed this on 4 mature hardy hibiscus ( 2 years old and 3ft tall) to address Japanese Beetles..  They appear to be gone but they were already into when they disappear so I cannot confirm it was the spray.  (5 stars if I could confirm it took care of the beetles)AnnualsI sprayed it on two small posts of red salvia and white begonias as a preventative against leaf miner which I eradicated about a month prior.  No sign of sock.RosesI sprayed on two mini roses (7 months old planted from root ball) as a preventative.HydrangeasI can say that in one day the spray, even after a heavy rain, significantly reduced rust on my young phantom hydrangea (2 years flowering)  and two vanilla strawberry hydrangea trees (3 months no flowers).  Rose Rx works well but never this quickly and dramatically.The rust was the result of almost 3 weeks of rain to include 14 inches in one week.  After I sprayed, we had heavy rain that night and the next morning.  I checked and the rust had lightened significantly.  My phantom and trees was covered in rust and now it was almost gone.  I could not believe it.I sprayed this on my other hydrangeas, planted just a month ago and all with blooms (4 gallon pot size--Quickfire, Limelight, Inrediball, and 5 gallon Vanilla Strawberry shrub form).  I focused on the leaves but I am sure some got on the blooms.  I think it's safe for blooms but the package suggests not spraying because of bees and other pollinators.  I  did make sure there were no pollinators when I sprayed.  All the hydrangeas seem to be responding well; no sign of shock from the spray.  No problems with the blooms.NegativesThere is a strong odor and there has to be no wind. The leaves feel a little stiffer on all the hydrangea.  However, the types I listed have leaves naturally thicker and coarser feel.  I think the spray added a little more texture. Even after rain, the texture was still there so that at least tells me it adhered as the product describes.  The other negative is if you bring blooms and leaves in the house, I would be careful that there isn't a chance of the cuts coming into contact with food. This is a toxic, non organic spray.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

fungi,Chimique,B000RUJZS6,Thinking Out Loud,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2023","This product worked, once I really doused my plant in it.I moved into a house with lots of flowering plants in the yard, but I knew nothing about gardening. I first noticed black spots and white powdery stuff on a giant rhododendron in 2020. Was it a fungus? Mildew? I had no idea. Not thinking much of it, I just trimmed away the handful of affected branches.The black spots and white powder were back in 2021. I bought this spray and used it kind of meekly. I can be mechanically challenged and was actually intimidated by the hose connection; the printed instructions made it sound confusing but once I saw the spraying mechanism, it made sense. I was surprised at how big and far-reaching the spray was, so doing a quick once-over seemed like enough at the time.In 2022, the black spots and white powder came back with a vengeance. Now I was getting worried. I actually did 3 things:1. I aggressively cut away the blighted branches. I mean, I really butchered it.2. I cut away branches that were low to the ground and reached waaaaay under the bush to rake away old fallen leaves and dead branches. Maybe this is obvious and something an experienced homeowner would do as regular maintenance, but it was something new for this gardening newb.3. I used this spray GENEROUSLY. I started on the far side and made sure the spray reached the very back of the bush, top to bottom, then slowly made my way around the plant, making sure the spray reached the trunk and every inch of interior branches and leaves.Now it's 2023, and I put down new mulch in the spring. I've been so relieved to see new leaves growing in to fill all the empty spots that had been cut away, and I'm thrilled to report that I see NO black spots or white powdery stuff!!So, along with trimming and doing general plant clean-up, I do credit this spray with reviving my rhododendron.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Kinda knew what it was but thought spiders only got outdoors this is my first time really going hard or whatever indoors. Picked one up and splat, luckily it wasn't mature. There were several in all the pots I tried all the oil stuff/ need-humbolt oils that said it would knock them out. They all seem to work but only for a few days, and the one thing in assuming none of them did that this stuff did was kill the eggs and the spiders. I only had to apply this stuff twice and I have seen one egg or sack since. With the other stuff, every 3 or 4 days it was like the eggs would even multiply and I would really soak them and do it at night with the lights off.

fungi,Chimique,B000RUJZS6,Craig,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2019","This is a very hard one to write, but I feel compelled to share my experiences since I’ve only used this to eradicate mites on my indoor houseplants.First off, yes, this completely annihilated the creepy critters that I’d first found on an Alocasia. The alocasia survived, but I feel like it does have a slightly slower growth ever since. It’s not a flourishing plant, but the bugs are gone.The second time I used it was on my variegated monstera, which I discovered a ton of tiny white mites crawling in the top soil. Addressing the top soil, they are completely gone. This was very recent so I am still hopeful the plant survives.The reason I want to write this review is to let you know this is a VERY harsh chemical. Do not use it unless it’s an absolute emergency. Wear a face mask, goggles and kitchen gloves and only use the product outside. The odor alone will make you cough, and I personally am not one that coughs other than for the extremely obvious reasons. I’d recommend a shower after as well. Set it to a mist and use it sparingly so you don’t give your plants too much of this. Good luck with whatever you’re dealing with. I will recommend this stuff, but yeah I’ve personally referred to this product as “the crazy stuff”.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Well I tried all of those. I tried soap and water. I tried blasting the buggers off. I soaked the soil in the stuff.  But the treatments destroyed my plants and the mites ALWAYS came back with a vengeance.I tried looking up chemical miticides but information is just apparently really hard to find - probably because the entire internet is crowded with junk advice like the above. But I did eventually find this. They advertise as ""Science-based"" and I do love me some science. I read the ingredients, read the MSDS for the solution as well as each of the active ingredients separately, and of course checked reviews. And then I bought it.AND THIS STUFF WORKS.Mites gone. Plants healthy. No, I mean HEALTHY. I haven't seen the leaves on my plumeria look this good in ages! It also eliminated the cross-contaminated mites from my citrus bonzai.

Sometimes you have to spray a couple of times in case you missed a spot, but it works. That being said, this isn't your hippie dippie ""DIY get rid of mealy bugs with these 5 regular household ingredients!"" this is a POTENT chemical insecticide/miticide/fungicide and wearing PPE is a MUST.

One ingredient in common is the fungicide Tebuconazole. In the #06328687 they REDUCED the amount of the ingredient by about 20% which is why you likely need to apply it more often. Applied every 14 days makes this product 3Xs more expensive!! No thanks. These companies are getting greedy.

fungi,Chimique,B0049PL9PC,Skittles512,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2020","This product is incredibly easy and so effective to use. This year, I planted tropical milkweed. After a couple months of beautiful growth, much to my dismay, aphids decided to invade the plant. The plant started dropping leaves and all the remaining leaves were turning yellow. It looked like the Charlie Brown Christmas Tree of plants. I honestly thought I would need to remove the milkweed, as it seemed covered with bugs and (eggs?)... disclaimer, I do not have a green thumb, am new to ornamentals-  and was at a loss as to what to do here. I read this product treated aphids, and while milkweed was not listed, was drawn to the idea of placing granules on the ground and letting the product do the job. I was nervous about liquid insecticides and such, having never used products like that before and liked the idea of a fertilizer with this product. I treated this milkweed similar to a shrub and used half a capful and watered it in thoroughly. I didn’t bother burying it like it suggested; just sprinkled it around the base and watered in. In about a week, this plant looks like it has come alive and completely looks different. I see no live bugs on it and new leaves have sprouted out everywhere, and it looks so perky. It has completely saved the plant. I’m now planning on using it on some of my other shrubs/plants as I am excited by how well the fertilizer portion helped the milkweed.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

fungi,Chimique,B0049PL9PC,Onyx joy,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2022","I had been fighting a fungus and some sort of caterpillar that was eating the roses. I tried this product it does a good job with fertilizing. My roses started to grow faster with more blooms. The fungus went away so did the bugs but when the time frame for it to work came up it definitely stopped working. It has to be applied the number of weeks that it says in the directions to keep the product working all season. It was not very easy to apply because you have to measure the amount into the provided measuring cup and then put that amount into your watering can. I have a lot of roses I should have purchased the one that connects directly to the hose.  I imagine  that would have made application easier. The pellet form of the product I have also used and that is very difficult to apply because you have to dig up your dirt and put them in the ground, it’s more work to use those. As long as you follow the directions, the product does what it says it will do. Something which I don’t know if it’s related to the product or not, this winter I had a number of rosebushes that froze and even three of them froze to death. I had never had that happen before. I generally don’t cover my roses in the winter. I’m in Chicago. Last summer was the first summer I used this product. Last winter was the first winter that I did anything for the roses to help them during the winter. I pruned them down and covered them with leaf mulch. Several of the roses that had stems sticking out above the leaf mulch had stems that froze and had to be cut back almost to the ground in the spring. Three of the roses died completely. I had never had that happen before. I have no idea if it is related to the fact that I used this product that summer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

About 8 years ago the leaves started turning yellow, the entire plant was looking sick due to mites.  We were spraying an insecticide on them 3 times a year, as directed by a professional agronomist.  After about 5 years, they plants were looking worse and worse but we weren't seeing an improvement in the mite infestation.  I ran across the Bayer 3-in1 product and began using it.  The leaves are now healthy, mite-free, and look at those blooms!!  They are full  of blooms. I have never seen rhododendrons so lush.  When I started using it on the rhododendrons, I also started using it on my azaleas and knock-out roses, having the same results.  Profuse blooms.  I also no longer have to spray my roses for Japanese beetles.  I find it much more pleasant to toss these granules at the base of my shrubs rather than spray nauseating insecticides on my lovely plants, plus I'm getting profusely blooming and healthy shrubs out of it. Highly recommend it!  I use the cap as the measuring cup.  the only problem I have is that I cannot get the lids off by myself until after my husband first opens them for me.

fungi,Chimique,B0049PL9PC,Errol Levine,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2015","I've used this product for three years and have obtained more for use during this spring and summer.  I live in the southwest which is not particularly hospitable to any plants let alone roses.  The humidity is very low and the clay-like soil is devoid of most nutrients.  Prior to using Bayer Advanced All-in-One all my roses developed powdery mildew and black spot fungus as soon as the weather warmed up.  I have found this product to be pretty effective in preventing these diseases.  Last year my Henry Kelsey, Stairway to Heaven  and Cl. Jeanne LaJoie roses were all spared infestations.  One Nearly Wild Rose (Floribunda) developed some powdery mildew.  All-in-One is therefore good for preventing infestations and diseases but is not 100 per cent effective in this regard.  I did not think All-in-One produced more blooms than conventional granular fertilizers.  I have also found that for maximal effectiveness it is better to apply this product every four weeks  and not every six weeks as recommended by the manufacturer.  Another change that I made was to water the roots prior to applying All-in-One.  The volume of each application as recommended in the instructions is small and I doubt that it can reach the entire root system without prior  and later watering.  Additionally, I used larger amounts than recommended by the manufacturer for larger rose bushes.  In conclusion, I find All-in-One indispensable.  I could not grow roses without it in my area.  I have not given it five stars though because I did not think it particularly effective in producing blooms that looked better or were more numerous than I got with conventional granular fertilizers and I did not think that it prolonged the blooming period.  However, the convenience of a single product to provide fertilization, to prevent and treat insect infestations such as aphids  and to prevent and treat fungal diseases is a huge advantage of this product.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

The budding season can start in early March and run into late November or early December.

Haven't seen that in months and months. I noticed that a bee was suspicious also...his faced buried in exploration.For nearly a year I was immensely loyal to the recommended organic products for those trees, the granular fertilizer in exact doses and remembered schedule. I had a few brief glimpses of blooms. Mostly leaves. Chewed leaves. Some yellow. I added loyalty to neem oil in all its cold pressed purity, along with insecticidal soap. Nicely blended and shook. So proud of myself.The leaves didn't care, and the bugs felt right at home. I had more blooms in my toilet than those trees.This blue bottle isn't cheap and the company obviously tries to trick you toward overdose. It's darn tough to stay within the inner capful as opposed to spilling over toward the rim. It actually feels like you're doing the right thing. The designers were rolling in laughter on that one. You'll be shelling out another 20 bucks sooner than you think.I smoothed an 18 inch range surrounding the stem and worked this stuff into the soil. I don't claim it was wonderfully balanced. Most likely I had a 55-45 tilt toward one side or another. Mosquitoes were trying to straighten me out but recently I'm trending against them.Some added soil on top and a brief watering.

It would make the beetles get agitated and fly off but I didn't see any dead beetles. I used this Bayer Rose and Flower Care stuff and dead beetles were everywhere. I guess it'll kill bees which I don't like. But buying, planting and tending to flowers and plants adds up to a pretty big investment. I'm not willing to let bugs eat up all my work. Plus the Japanese Beetle thing in this area usually only goes for about a month. After that I can use some neem oil or that Seven stuff. I know that I see Bees, Bumblebees and a Bee type bug that's in between those two in size and they are doing OK. The Japanese Beetle problem here in Missouri usually runs from mid-June to mid-July. Last year I had them real bad in about two dozen rose plants I had. They'll burrow right down into the flower and eat all they can. They did that again with the dahlias I grew this year.

They both fight their best against fungus systemically- Neem oil works best against insects topically, so doing 14 day rotations with the two help your Roses defense while they are getting healthy (fertilizer application, removal of diseased leaves on ground, and on plant - but you have to leave enough leaves so the plant can survive) and as soon as you see your roses getting better start to put less then no Bayer. :) Just use Bayer like an aspirin not a cure for healthy roses! Your fertilization should come from better sources then Bayer.I DO recommend this product as long as you don't overuse.I also hope my review was helpful!!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

But when I tried it on other flowering plants (bacopa for instance) that had whiteflies it worked very poorly although label says it kills whiteflies. Even daily spraying didn't help. They claim it is also systemic - well I saw no evidence of that over several weeks because the whiteflies were just fine. I finally used Bonide's indoor houseplant systemic granules for insects and even though this flowering plant was outdoors in a pot, that worked although it took a few days. So while Rose Shield may be systemic for its fungicide I don't think it is for bugs since on other plants I tried literally for weeks, daily, to kill those whiteflies and they just kept coming. I could get the backs of leaves to be clear of all whiteflies while spraying but they came right back so I don't think it was due to eggs hatching. I think it just doesn't work as systemic for bugs.

fungi,Chimique,B0CCYD7ZF3,amandapanda,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2022","Do your research. Research the top ingredients of this product.Difenoconazole and Thiamethoxam appear to make spider mite infestations worsen, and speed up their reproduction.I can say from experience this is a fact.I purchased this as an effort to find a systemic that will work on Spider Mites, as I had a few houseplants that had very mild infestations (maybe one or two mites per leaf, no webbing etc)After using this product, the mites exploded and tripled. I resorted to using MiteX, which in the past would wipe out the mites quickly. They returned with a vengeance, and the MiteX did absolutely nothing. I then used Captain Jacks Deadbug brew, and the mites keep coming back next day, no matter how much I treat.Stupidly, I thought maybe I didnt apply enough of the Rose Shield. So I did a second application a few weeks later.Again, the spider mites came back, FAST, and MANY. Almost immediately after that second application.After doing some research, I found that the top ingredients in this product actually are known to worsen spider mite infestations.... so why on EARTH is Bonide listing Spider Mites as a controlled pest.I contacted Bonide for help with this.They had stated that the reason why this product didnt work is because I used it on houseplants. This is BS. They said the spider mites that I have on my houseplants must be different than the spider mites outdoors. Which again, BS. I have identified the mites Im battling as two-spotted and red mites, which are common to infect outdoor plants as well as houseplants.They seemed more concerned about me using this product on houseplants. I figured since the bottle said that the area was safe to inhabit once the spray was dry, meant that it would be okay on houseplants as long as you weren't spraying them inside. But apparently not, apparently co-existing with plants indoors that were previously treated with this chemical is very dangerous to you and your pets health. I understand that houseplants werent listed on the label. But a lot of houseplants are considered ornamentals, which are listed on the label.So 3 reasons I cant recommend this product:-It doesnt work as described-It seems to be more dangerous of a chemical than the label makes it seem-Poor customer service",1.0 out of 5 stars,

I've been using it for a while now, and it's been a pretty reliable ally in my gardening battles.The effectiveness is pretty decent. It does a good job of controlling most common weeds and my lawn has definitely seen better days since I started using it. It’s not perfect - a few stubborn ones still peek through now and again, but it's managed to keep the majority at bay.The mixing and application process is straightforward, although, I'd have appreciated a bit more clarity on the instructions.Where it really shines, though, is its lasting effect. I've noticed fewer applications are needed compared to other products I've tried, which is definitely a win in my book.While I've had a good run with Atrazine, there's a small room for improvement. If the product could tackle all the weed varieties and the instructions were a bit clearer, it'd be hitting a solid 5 stars. Still, all in all, a solid 4-star performer.

herbs,Chimique,B0052MZBYQ,Bryan,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2020","There may be local or state laws regarding how you can use Atrazine in your yard.  I try to be careful, using it once a year only, but this last winter was an exception.An invasive grass invaded my St. Auustine Palmetto backyard over the winter, and I have had a heck of a time getting rid of it.  It is a creeping type grass that came from one of my neighbors yards.  I've been able to dig a barrier on the property line to keep it from happening again, and now I""m dealing with what's remaining in my yard.The Atrazine did kill the surface greens with one application.  It took about 7 to 10 days, so don't expect the instant effects that glyphosate gives.  Now, part of the issue here is that after about a month, the grass started growing back.  I expected this might happen, so I fully expected to have to do two applications.  I tried to space them as much apart as possible knowing that I really shouldn't do a third application until next year.Here is where it got interesting.  After the greens died from the second application, they started coming back again.  But most of the new grass started growing from old, brown shoots that were left behind from the less-than-stellar thatch job that I did (I was too worried about killing my St. Augustine).  That meant that most of the new shoots were really easy to find and dispose of by hand.  That was actually kind of fun...but on a pair of gloves, follow the steam as close to the ground as possible, and give it a good yank.  Watch in wonder as five other nearby tufts came out in one fell swoops.My lawn is recovering.  I'm convinced that as long as I do rudimentary hand weeding once a week through the summer, that I will be able to solve the problem.  There were some large dead areas where the invasive grass had completely taken over, and the St. Augustine is filling them nicely.The truth is, there really wasn't any alternative to this to do the job I needed to do.  I didn't necessarily need to kill every weed in my backyard.  I just needed to get them down to a manageable level.  This did the job.And now I know that just because it's wintertime in Phoenix doesn't mean that I can neglect my yardwork.EDIT:After a good six months, the area where I heavily treated my lawn looks amazing with a couple of caveats.Essentially the middle of my yard is perfect.  The borders are not-so-perfect.  I tried solarizing one half (worked extremely well, but I left a tarp over that section of the yard for a good 8 weeks).  I tried doing some small spot spraying on the other half.  What I learned is that this stuff *will* kill St. Augustine if you apply too much.I think I'm pretty much done using it, though.  I ended up using a little less than half of the bottle, but I also have a very small yard.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
herbs,Chimique,B0052MZBYQ,Dan,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2020","2021 update:The stuff works (eventually), but there are significant drawbacks.Pros - It does work (eventually) to kill weeds without harming centipede.Cons:* Even under optimum conditions following a recent rain and applying at the recommended concentration of 4.5 oz/gal, it takes a minimum of 2 weeks to see any results and 3-4 weeks for a complete kill.  The problem is that many weeds can mature and go to seed within that period of time which means a brand new batch next year.* The label claims pre-emergence weed control, but early spraying does not seem to reduce spring weeds.* Internal medicine MD's are now starting to link atrazine with the same immunosuppression and male hormone suppression effects as BPA in plastics, so take appropriate precautions to avoid contact or inhaling when spraying.Overall, 2, 4D acts much faster on centipede lawns with nearly the range of weed types killed.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072289CA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Use it first and save the atrazine for whatever it doesn't get, if you use it at all.2020 Update:Four weeks after initial application about 75% of treated weeds are showing signs of distress.

It takes a good 1-2 weeks to see measurable dieback of weeds, and works best on young weeds that have recently started to germinate.  Timing is important..It kills weeds at the roots, so you have to water it in good.

However, I'm going to try using it again next year to see if it was my own fault. I SUSPECT I DIDN'T MIX IT THOROUGHLY ENOUGH. It's really important to pay close attention to the instructions. Maybe I need to follow my own advice.I had a bunch of mallow-type weeds. Spectracide and Ortho - even with 2, 4-D as an ingredient - didn't do anything to the mallow. I did some research and it seems that those consumer weed-killers don't have enough 2, 4-D to kill more robust weeds like mallow. Both on Google and Youtube, people recommended getting 2, 4-D, mixing it per the instructions and applying it RATHER than the consumer grade herbicides.I mixed the Southern Ag product with water and surfactant per the directions. I can't guarantee that I did it right. I sprayed the mix on mallow throughout my yard.The weeds that I sprayed first developed white patches/spots after a week. They stopped growing and slowly, over a few weeks, clearly died and withered away.Many of the weeds that I sprayed, as I got to the bottom of the mix, did not develop those same white patches. They didn't shrivel up and about a month after treatment, they were still there. It may be that I didn't mix the 2, 4-D, water and surfactant adequately because there was a big difference in the effectiveness of the first areas that I sprayed vs the last areas.I have quite a bit left and plan to try again next year.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Chimique,B0072289CA,WyrdDragn,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2024","This combination is specifically for controlling bindweed and NOT meant to be used willy nilly. If you've dealt with bindweed, you already understand the frustration. Use ~ 4oz of 2,4-D per gallon of glyphosate. This is best applied when bindweed is actively growing in spring and early summer. Note that it will take at least 2 seasons to kill an established bindweed patch if all new growth is sprayed weekly. Bindweed has an EXTENSIVE root system (15+ feet vertically and growing 10+ feet in diameter Per Season) so the exercise is to starve this massive root system. Which requires removing or killing any top growth as quickly as possible to starve the root system. This combination penetrates further into the root system than glyphosate or 2,4-D alone so the plant has to spend more energy regenerating that root system thus starving it faster.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I opened it all up as carefully as I could to find that of the two quart bottles of Amine I’d ordered had been crushed, and nearly all the weed killer had oozed out. (The shipper had simply put two bottles in a bubble-wrap mailer. I would have expected the package to be bagged and boxed, but what do I know?)I cleaned the mess up best I could, wiped everything down, stored the weed killer in a well-ventilated spot in my shed, washed up in the cold outdoor hydrant, and went inside to write a note to the shipper explaining the whole mess, asking them to maybe call the Postmaster to apologize. Within a day or two I received an answer from the shipper saying they would replace the quart that had been damaged. Cool ‘nuff.All this was a million miles away from my mind a few days later when I was out in my grove clearing a bit of deadwood and my phone rang. My wife. I pulled my gloves off and poked the “answer” button. “Hello?”“I need help!” *thud* silence.My wife is disabled and has many health issues. If Usain Bolt had been there, I’m pretty sure I’d have beat him to the house by quite a wide margin - in less than a minute I opened the front door to see my wife laying on the floor, walker on its side. Just as I reached her she went into a full-body seizure. I cradled her head in my hands to keep her from whanging her bean on the floor too hard and waited for the seizure to pass, but just a few seconds into the seizure she made an odd gasping noise and quit breathing. CRAP! The seizures happen fairly often, but it's rare for her to quit breathing.I held her head a few more seconds until her seizure rolled her over on her side, then I bolted to her room to get her nebulizer and asthma medication. Just as I had the nebulizer plugged in and the medicine was percolating into mist her seizure ended. I got the mouthpiece into her and kinda shook her a bit hoping to God she’d start breathing again. Thankfully she did, a very small gasp, then as a bit of the medicine got into her airway a very large gasp. Within seconds she was breathing normally again and regained consciousness shortly after. She gazed up at me, a tender look in her eye, and very gently said, “What the hell stinks? I can barely breathe!”I blinked at her for a moment, trying to figure out what… Oh crap! My gloves! I’d used those gloves when I’d cleaned the chemical spill days before! I’d dropped them on the floor by the door when I ran in, and I probably had some of the chemical smell on my hands as well from wearing the gloves earlier.As all this crossed my mind in a flash my wife closed her eyes and quit breathing again. In a whirlwind I got more asthma meds in the inhaler, threw my gloves out the door, ran my hands under the sink, and shook her back to consciousness again - again she was able to get a few breaths of the medicine in and was able to breathe easier and woke up. Within a few minutes her breathing had settled down and we were able to get her up and back into her bed… And life went on.Needless to say, I put up a couple hooks outside on the deck where I keep my work gloves now, and when I spray for weeds I entertain the neighbors by taking all my clothes off outside before going in for the day.So - as I said earlier, the product itself works fine and merrily kills weeds as advertised, no problem there. And the fact that it almost killed my wife isn't the issue either - it's powerful stuff and has appropriate warnings on the bottle. But I do wish the shipper had bagged and boxed the shipment rather than sending it out in a bubble-wrapped mailer - it would have saved me a lot of stress had they done so.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I have lived here for 14 years and never thought twice about my yard. This year, I decided I was going to mow my own grass, and realized how fast these suckers grow!! If I had been taking care of my yard properly, I could have an amazing yard, but I neglected my duties. Hated to resort to chemicals, but I let this problem become way out of control, so here we are. I sprayed 4/20 (mowed 3 days prior) and today is 4/23 and they are almost ALL DEAD!! I mowed again this morning but the mower couldn't even reach them because they are all shriveled up and dying. Makes me a little sad. I'M KIDDING!! Bye, dandelions!I didn't have a measuring spoon, so I mixed three splashes (?-they were small splashes) into a two gallon sprayer with water and put a squirt of Gain dish soap. Yes, I know how precise that is, just trying to be honest. I knew not to use too much based on reviews but I have an ESTABLISHED problem that I thought required an extra splash...(instructions for two gallons of water was more like two splashes)I didn't even know what kind of grass I have, I didn't care! I said if it all dies, it dies. I'll start over. But it didn't touch the grass!! This product is great. For anyone saying it killed your grass, it might be that your yard was like mine and full-on weeds, so now they are all gone and it's bare. I will definitely be planting seeds to fill gaps in about 30 days or so. Will absolutely need another treatment in the fall but these weeds didn't grow overnight (except they really did) so they won't be gone overnight (except they almost are!)If you have a problem like mine, this stuff works.

herbs,Chimique,B0072289CA,jpmd,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2015","I tried this out because I had read a table that listed it as somewhat compatible with Perennial Peanut. I think this data came from a University of Florida Ag. publication.My hopes were to spray it in the general area of the weeds and hope that it (a) didn't kill my Perennial Peanut and (b) didn't kill what is left of my Bahiagrass.It turns out that 2,4 D Amine is great for weed control but NOT when you want to keep your Perennial Peanut unharmed. Within a day my weeds had begun to brown and wilt, I was so happy. Within a week, all of my peanut had turned brown and disappeared. My wife laughed at me because I was so sure of myself and my decision. I was devastated. Hank Hill would not approve.To its credit, the 2,4 D Amine got to work within 24 hours, devastating all of my weeds. My introverted neighbor actually came out of his house and crossed the street to ask me for a dose because it worked so well; this guy doesn't like talking to anybody if he doesn't have to. He even gardens at night because nobody is around and the sun isn't out. I was glad to share, hoping that the weeds would have a harder time crossing the street, back into my yard. Amazing stuff, although, I don't think it is intended for my application. It is great for making friends too I guess.The Perennial Peanut did not fare so well, nor did some of my bushes (I didn't think I had sprayed them, just near them, but apparently a little bit goes a long way).  The novela length instructions boiled down to something like ""A pint per acre with enough water to spread it"" which wasn't too helpful since I was using this on my front lawn.The good news: my peanut has bounced back in all of the places where I had lost hope. Relief! I purchased in August of 2015, applied the poison in September, cried a week later. It is now December and all of my peanut has rebounded.The bad news: the weeds are starting to pop up as well. I blame nature. I also blame my neighbor's outdoor cats (feral?) who like to sleep in my front lawn - most likely the ones rolling around with seeds stuck in their fur.  Considering one application controlled the weeds for 4 months, I am content.I still have 90% of the jug left, even after loaning some to my neighbor who has now offered for me to borrow tools ""anytime.""I will make a second attempt, only this time I will be more careful to steer clear of my peanut and important plants.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I used rain boots, waterproof gloves, pants, long sleeves and a mask because this is a chemical and it says use PPE. Waited until the weather was right, rained the day before and no rain for at least 24 hours after spraying. Sprayed the entire yard. In about 3 weeks my yard looked completely different.

herbs,Chimique,B0072289CA,User 1,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2017","I think the reason I like this product so much is that you get to control the amount of dilution as opposed to a ""Weed and Feed"" type product that you hook to the end of your water hose which always seem to be too watered down to have any affect regardless of the amount of times that I spray the same area. I simply take an empty Weed and Feed container (the type that hooks to your water hose) and I fill it with several glugs of the 2,4-D Amine and the rest I fill with water. I spray the yard immediately after mowing while the weeds are freshly cut open and exposed so the product gets to the root faster. I spray again later that week and then I finish a few days later by spot spray with a gallon hand pump carry-along sprayer...that I dilute to a similar ratio. This killed most of the variety of weeds that I had in my yard. It did not kill my grass, I have a mixture of St. Augustine and Bermuda. It also had no ill affect on my Zera-scape garden which contains a variety of cactus. Just a word of caution it will kill wild flowers. You can smell the product in the yard but it is not over-powering. I was tired of always pulling my weeds and never actually making a difference in the overall look of my yard. My neighbors are the types of people who never spray or pull their weeds, they simply mow them and they multiply to the point that now their yards are entirely comprised of weeds and they in fact have no grass left at all. I am sure that my neighbors can smell the chemicals in my yard but you have to fight fire with fire. I am so glad I found this product, I know it is powerful stuff and people say not to use for residential properties but I am not having any side effects...yet....I'm sure I'll get cancer and die one day but who can say for sure what caused it.

herbs,Chimique,B0072289CA,Mark Twain,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2017","Summary:This kills weeds like Dandelion 100% dead. Unfortunately 2-4D alone is not as “broad-spectrum” as you’d imagine. Try a mixture of: dicamba, quinchlorac, triclopyr, sedge hammer, and 2-4D. Obv. Dont mix every chemical full strength. “Trimmec” will give you good ratios to match.Took 2-3 applications: 80% killed clover, 100% killed dandilion (like it never existed), and killed maybe 40-55% of all weeds. Turned wild violet yellow for 1 day. No effect to creeping charlie, wild onion, wild garlic.+2 stars because this is the cheapest broad spectrum you will find and it did not remotely damage any grass. But -2 stars because dicamba (added), triclopyr (raw chemical), and trimec (a brand name mixture) are all much more effective when mixed at a broad spectrum kill.Depends on the weeds you have, this may be a very very good product. I have to move on to crossbow, trichlopyr, dicamba, trimmec, quinchlorac, or oxalis killer.Most places say you cannot respray within 2 weeks. I find 3-5 days assuming ground temps above 60F and air temp below 90F should be ok. You can always follow up with a 1/2 strength mixture.If you dont see folding over weeds by day 5 (and ground temp is 60F) - the product did not work - spray again, increase dosage, add surfactant, or try dicamba/trimmec/triclopyr. By day 10 you should see severe yellowing of weeds and close death. If it does not look severe at day 10 they could bounce back. Spot spray those weeds!No effect on fescue turf grass or crabgrass. I did notice a very slight light green or yellowing effect on rye grass I sprayed heavy (trying to get hidden weeds). I also noticed most grasses seemed to grow faster that week.I mixed 1 tablespoon per 2 gallons and sprayed approx 2500sq ft. focusing on weeds and ignoring grass. Repeated for remaining yard. Directions say 0.25fl oz (1.5 teaspoons) per gallon per 1000sq ft. Definitely use a non-ionic surfactant at 1 tablespoon per gallon per 1000sq ft.I find Methylated Seed Oil (MSO) + a Non-Ionic Surfactant (NIS) each at approx. 1 tablespoon per gallon will help a lot with weed herbicide penetration.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I cannot understand why people are on here saying this product killed their grass, outside of them not following instructions on how to mix the concentrate with water.

This will be my go to product for spot-spraying weeds in my yard in the future.Update 3/9/20: just a heads up, weeds need to be actively growing when applying this weed killer. In other words, it will not kill weeds in colder temperatures (less than 65 degrees F). My experience is optimal effectiveness comes with outside temps between 70-80 degrees.

I couldn't remember the specific brand he used but he said it was expensive ($70-$100/gallon) but worth it. He typically sprays not only his yard, but all his neighbors too just to keep things looking nice and he said a gallon normally lasts a whole summer season. I found my way to this product which I know is different, but still had a high percentage of the chemical he told me about. It's safe for the grass, but still takes care of the broadleaf weeds. It's a little hard to know how much to use, but I've been starting with about two ounces (or two small measurements full with the bottle measurement cup) per gallon.

I've been paying a lawn care company $60/mo for a smaller area of lawn and they can't seem to get the wild violets under control. Their only recommendation is to tear out the lawn and start over. The sod was just put down a few years ago. I discovered from the fellow who cares for my trees and shrubs, that the reason this stuff is so ineffective, is that it just rolls off the leaves. If you look closely, you'll notice that, for the most part, the only parts that actually die, are the edges of the leaves, which catch the liquid. He advised me to look for products with a simple additive that helps the herbicide stick to the leaves. For those already owning this stuff, you can actually add as smidgen of wood glue (yes, that's right, wood glue) to the mix, and that will help the herbicide stick to the surface of the weeds without clogging your sprayer. It's that easy. Meanwhile, the Southern Ag people surely know this and ought not sell this stuff without the additive.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

For the first 8 or 9 days, Icouldn't help but think they should have called this product; Miracle Grow lol.I am going to guess that this product is no worse than others outon the market 'today', but I will conclude with certainty, that from myexperience, using this product was a massive fail, and I will pass, onconsidering the purchase of anything else from Ortho in the future.The kicker is the claim from Ortho of 'Visible results within3 hours' , to paraphrase, and having read positive reviews here on amazon.Have a great day all!Initial Review:Here is the big issue I've had with this product;I followed directions to the tee, we're going on 7 days now, they look ashealthy as when I sprayed them. By now I have lots of new weedscoming up, its the season, natural, but who can tell which ones need to besprayed NOW? ACKKKK!!!

herbs,Chimique,B085YW8G1H,Stephen Throop,"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2021","The ramp in the photo is too wide and low to weed underneath with any tool I have. It’s so big and heavy that if I pick it up to weed, it’s tough to replace it without damaging the building. I’ve depended on glyphosate. In my experience, it takes several days to see if glyphosate is working. During that period, weeds keep growing and I don’t know if I need to spray again.The last time, it took a week to kill the weeds. Two days later, new weeds were already quite big. I bought Groundclear to work faster and longer.A gallon of concentrate makes  5.3 gallons of mix, so it would be expensive to spray a large area. I made a liter. I put the bottle of a 2-liter pump-up sprayer on a scale, added 190 grams of concentrate, and added water to bring it up to 1,000. That was plenty for the ramp area and to test on other trouble spots.Later that afternoon, the crab grass and wire grass looked rusty and wilted. I took the photo 24 hours later. The camera still didn’t show had bad the leaves looked.  I had also sprayed broadleaf weeds. I kept an eye on them for 10 days and saw no change. Maybe their leaves were more water repellent. Next time, I’ll add a little dish liquid.Pelargonic acid ""burns"" leaves. It’s 1% of the spray. It’s a fatty acid that’s in some human foods. It harms only leaves, and some weeds can grow new leaves.Imazapyr is 0.1% of the spray. Absorbed by roots, it kills plants. That rules out using Groundclear near shrubs or trees. In the soil, its half-life is in months, so it may work for a year. It helps to wash it in soon because light reduces the half-life to days.Keeping weeds from sprouting would greatly reduce weed problems. I’ve found that an application of Prodiamine will prevent sprouting for a couple of months. It takes only 5-15 grams per thousand square feet, so it’s cheap to use. For smaller jobs, I have a scale that reads to .01 gram.Prodiamine doesn't kill existing weeds or prevent encroachment, so Groundclear offers more protection. I’ve ordered a 1.5-liter sprayer. I don’t anticipate needing so much at one time, but if I keep the sprayer in a cardboard box to protect the herbicide from light, I’ll probably use it often.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

We get every kind of weed I think it's possible to grown in eastern America, and controlling them, especially in my long gravel driveway, is a nightmare.I try to stay as organic as I can, so finding an herbicide that doesn't kill weeds AND everything else is of concern to me. I don't want to harm the many amphibians, reptiles, and birds that inhabit my property.So after researching this Ortho GroundClear Year Long Vegetation Killer and seeing that its active ingredients are lethal to plants and nothing else, I decided to give it a try.My first pass, I goofed and got the mixture half strength. Still, it killed most of the weeds, even diluted. Another light pass at full-strength a month later knocked everything else dead.Well, except for one kind of woody weed. The instructions say that it's a lethal herbicide for your typical weeds and grasses, and it did indeed kill everything except for this one heavy-stemmed weed I can't identify. Still, I've never had anything do as well as this Ortho mix, so I'm thrilled with the results and will hand-remove the few stragglers.I first sprayed a couple months ago, so I'm confident that at this stage, with almost everything still dead, that it will last me through the rest of the year. But will it go six-months after that, as the ""One Year"" label promises? I dunno, but it's not a crushing disappointment if I have to redo this next spring.Recommended if you want a lethal, long-lasting herbicide that really works and isn't toxic to every living thing on the planet, just plants.

In fact it doesn't do a very good job killing poison ivy at all (and it isn't designed to do that). I took a star off because unless you really saturate the plants it works really slowly. In some cases the grasses have a chance to grow around the dying stuff so the slow effect doesn't really save me from having to get the string trimmer out. I have a pole fence on 3 acres and I don't want to do all that trimming. But, of you do saturate the plants around the poles well they will die and you can avoid a lot of trimming. I'd suggest buying twice as much as you think you'll need and using it liberally. Because it doesn't really affect below ground roots, nusiance trees will grow where the grass and weeds die.

When spraying broad leafed weeds you'll find they start to discolor before you've finished your spraying rounds.  Grass is great for your yard, but it tends to show up almost everywhere you don't want it and the Ortho makes quick work of that too.Normally more expensive than the other brands, I couldn't believe my luck when I went to buy again and found 2 gallons of concentrate going for $30.

It won't kill every plant known to man, and that's not a problem.  All herbicides have limitations and recommended uses.  This product kills many grasses and broadleaf weeds (which means this product kills most of what you'll encounter in many residential areas).  If you're trying to kill Mesquite or other exotic plants like cactus on the ranch, you'll need to do some Googling to find the right mix of poisons to match your local area (e.g. use Sendero to kill Mesquite).I use this product every year to kill weeds that come up in mulch beds and hardscapes (e.g. grass between pavers, in gravel, etc.).  It works great, and one treatment generally lasts the full year if you spray in March or April when the growing season in Texas starts with warmer weather.  Sometimes I end up spot-spraying a few new weeds that poke up in the following cool season (e.g. October'ish), but that's not unexpected.Great price (~$42 in hyperinflation 2022) for 2 gallons of concentrate.  Mix 24 ounces of product per gallon of water (you can make ten gallons per two-gallon bottle of concrete).  This goes a long way for most homeowner scenarios (e.g. sidewalks, driveways, mulch beds, around the pool, etc.).

The Pros: per bottle it’s  not expensive like most weed killers on the market, but depending on your sprayer it’s pretty much a one time use per bottle.  AND  #2.., it does the job and it does it fast,  Would I buy this again??  Honestly, probably not. It’s a good product, but value per dollar… it’s not for meUpdate 6/21/21.  It’s been a month since I sprayed and normally there would be new growth popping up by now, even with other ground clear.  There is nothing. I’m impressed.  So it may be more economical than originally thought.  evenUsing the majority of a bottle in my 1gallin sprayer, if I only have to do it once, I’m ahead.  So I’m going to order 3 more.  Louisiana summers can be brutally hot so the less yard work I have to do is a plus.  I have to recommend this 100% if you want Ground Clear as it seems to do exactly that for me.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Chimique,B085YW8G1H,Momerath,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2023",Great for dirt/gravel areas you want to keep free of weeds. I live in the Phoenix area and have found this works best if applied a day or so before some expected rain. If I need to treat and there's no rain in the forecast I follow the treatment up by spraynig the area with hose water - just enough to help the chemicals get down to the roots. If treating existing weeds they will take 1-2 weeks to visibly die back. Smaller weeds die off quicker since they have smaller root systems. The bigger the plant and its root system the longer it will take for the weed to completely die. Once treated the areas remained mostly free of weeds for 6 months to a year. Just a few managed to come up that were easy enough to pull by hand in between. Bare areas remained bare - so this works well as a pre-treatment.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Organic,B09G93GRT2,Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2024","Here in So Cal, weeds follow rain like clockwork. And since there was an untended lot across the street from me, I have about 15 years of weed seed accumulated in the soil. In addition, I'm trying to install a drought-tolerant native landscape, which requires that I clear the front yard first.Digging out weeds and grasses turned out to be a never-ending task. I have tried many different options, including hand weeding, various ""organic"" weed killer, flame torch, and glyphosate and decided to try this one.First, it is not OMRI (organic gardening) certified. But being a chemist, I researched the online Safety Data Sheet and found that it is mostly C8 and C10 saturated organic acids, which can be derived from coconut oil, with 20% ""other"" (nonlisted, therefore presumably non-hazardous surfactant). According to what I can find, the active ingredients are non-cancerous, not persistent, and do not bio-accumulate. That's a plus.Taking a cue from other reviews, I mixed it at the higher concentration and sprayed it on a variety of emerging and established weeds and grasses.First of all, it works really well on most newly-emergent weeds and grasses, including spurge, foxtail, and oxalis. It coats leaves evenly and - unlike glyphosate- ""burns"" them quickly, so I can see in two days where I missed, and re-spray where necessary.It does NOT work on established grasses, even tho I saturated some clumps thoroughly, and does NOT workon common mallow.Because it only works on leaves, and not seeds, it must be re-applied on each new crop of  sprouting weed and grass seeds. But because of the nature of this weed killer, I feel more comfortable re-spraying, and with each application there are fewer and fewer sprouts to contend with. Overall, this spray will make clearing the yard much easier, and reduce the amount of hand-digging by about 70%.It IS pricey, but because of the combination of positive qualities and the amount of work it will save, I feel it's worth the cost.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Please note that I used this brush killer on diluted and full strength! One of the things that definitely helped was that I or the brush killer into a 2 1/2 gallon sprayer, and I clipped as many of the branches as I could so as to expose the interior of the freshly cut branches so that the brush killer could penetrate inside. I made sure I sprayed as much as could reasonably drain into each individual large branch and stalk-- and within one week the entire batch of crêpe myrtles was dead! I also sprayed the brush killer full strength on some of the leaves, and I also used the remaining amount to pour as strategically as possible toward the root area of the crêpe myrtles so they would get the maximum effect, but was careful not to pour outside of the immediate root area.

At around $15-$16 it is less expensive than at the local home improvement stores.  It delivers on time every time I've ordered it.  The bottles come with a seal under the cap so I've had no issues with spillage during shipping.When used as per the instructions it works to kill brush weeds like lambsquarter, poison ivy, etc. and other hard to kill weeds though it takes a couple of weeks to see the results on some weeds. So some patience is needed.I've also used it to kill small tree stumps up to 4 inches from trash trees that sprout around our property, though you have to use it undiluted on tree stumps for it to work.  So far it seems to work. The tree stumps look like the wood dries out gradually.My one complaint is that the last two times I've order this product through Amazon the measuring cup was missing. Previous orders came with the cups, but last two orders were missing the cup.  I can see how easy it is for the cup to fall off during handling as any slight pressure can make it pop off. Not sure if it's an Amazon warehouse handling issue where it falls off during their handling of the product and they now have a collection of the measuring cups or if it's a manufacturer issue. In either case better quality control is needed to ensure each bottle ships with its measuring cup. Fortunately, I still had a measuring cup from a previous purchase so wasn't a big deal for me.  For someone else it might be an issue if they don't have a measuring cup since you need to measure the amount to use per gallon of water.  It takes anywhere from 4oz to 8oz per gallon of water depending on the type of weeds your trying to kill.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

The firstly purchase in October 2023 worked great, including the sprayer, though it was the older version that had only an on/off switch to control the spray.Purchased a second bottle about 6 weeks later, November 2023, had a different sprayer, with both an on/off switch and grip handle actuator - would have been great had it worked, but the nothing pumped out - this is after inserting the pump,handler fully into the bottle, pulling out the protective battery film, fully unfolding the spray tip,and then twisting the tip from the off to spray position.  The pump would turn on but nothing would com out. I opened the bottle to see if it was a priming problem, but the issue was that the pump mechanism could barely pull the chemical up the tube maybe 1 inch.

So, I waited about a week and went back out to check on the vines and ALL the leaves and ALL the vines had turned from a vigorously growing green color to  a shriveled-up, dried-up, flat-out dead brown.

Here's the mixture I used...I have a 1 gallon pump sprayer, so in one gallon of water, I added 4 oz. of BioAdvanced Brush Killer  AND about a half a teaspoon of ""Liquid Harvest"" brand surfactant which I also purchased from Amazon.The Liquid Harvest surfactant is a ""spreader-sticker"" which allows the herbicide to spread out and stick to the berry leaves which makes the spray much more effective.

herbs,Chimique,B001DKBDHK,Ray Cassavaugh,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2020","I only use such products to rid my yard of years-long growths of blackberries. I used to use Round-Up and wanted a product with less history of potential cancer.  I tried this brand and it is different but effective.  Round-up often acts faster and more evidently on the leaves. This one takes longer before you notice the plant is suffering. But in the end it seems to work better at preventing regrowth.  It's not perfect. Blackberries are insidiously durable. You kill them in one spot and a few months later they are growing up a few yards away.  I believe this works better on slowing regrowth than Round-up but that may simply be that 4 or 5 years of treatments have overall weakened the bushes' ability to pop up elsewhere.  All in all, I think this is better than any other products I've used on the blackberries and recommend you try it.  Best to use in spring but wait til the plants have developed leaves and are at least a foot or more high so that the poison covers a larger area of foliage and and you get more absorption.  I use it liberally and soak the leaves thoroughly.Some new plants will pop up in a month or two.  I just pull them up at about 8 to 12 inches tall instead of wasting poison on them because the plants are going dormant in a month or so anyway.  But re-application on these new plants may be better in the long run.  You need to experiment to figure out what works for you.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Chimique,B001DKBDHK,Sue Logsdon,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2023","July 6:  I initially received the product quickly but it did not include the wand (which I paid extra for). I reached out to customer service and received a prompt reply, apologizing and saying they would send this out to me. Instead of sending it quickly, they sent it via USPS (apparently).  After a week, I reached out asking where it was and was told I would need to give it a full 7-10 days. Today is the 11th business day and nothing. I wrote back and was told they will send me another one. I assume it will take another 7-10 business days before I see if they actually send it.They are fast to respond, but very slow to deliver. I would suggest going elsewhere for this product or any others they sell.This is, in my opinion, very bad ""customer service"". If they wanted to keep me as a customer, they would have rectified their mistake by overnighting or at the least, 2 day delivery of the part they forgot to include! I paid extra for the part - I should have the part and not wait weeks upon weeks to get it.  Never again with this company.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I've used BioAdvanced Brush Killer for several years. It works and it works well! It's not instant, but it will kill anything you want gone and I have rarely needed to reapply. It eradicated poison ivy from my yard as well as VA Creeper and other offensive weeds and vines. It killed off a tree which was just a stump but kept regrowing for years - This product finally killed it off!  This year I have a new section of my yard that needs cleaning up and I ordered the 1.3-gallon size because it comes with the battery-operated wand (easier on my hands). It arrived in a couple of days, as promised, but without the wand. I contacted customer service and they replied the next business day and promised to send me the wand - in 7 -10 days. A little disappointed that I received the product in 2 days, but it will take a week or more to receive the missing part - but honestly - this stuff works so well that I'll wait!

I will update if ultimately the roots don't come back, but for now this product was a big help.OLD REVIEW:  I purchased mainly for blackberries.  I sprayed liberally on a huge hedge of blackberries on a mild day.  No rain.  Some leaves got spotted but after 3 weeks I was really surprised how poorly this worked.  There has been no rain.  Very disappointing.I cleared another area of blackberries as well a few months back, and the vines that were left in the ground 'sprouted' and came back to life..

I didn't know that for some reason, sedges are ""immune"" to Roundup, possibly because they have huge energy stores in that nut below ground.I bought Sedgehammer+ in April after reading reviews here, mixed it in my sprayer tank (1 pouch per 1 gallon, a per instructions), and sprayed everything that looked like a sedge. The sedges didn't die quickly (much slower than Roundup kills regular weeds), but they did stop growing and eventually the sedges looked brownish and died.My yard is approximately 4000 sq ft after subtracting the house and driveway concrete areas, so is much larger than the 1000 sq ft that one pouch (one gallon, mixed) can treat. However, I did not spray the entire yard with Sedgehsmmer+. I only sprayed the edges themselves, so one pouch was sufficient to treat the areas where I needed it.Attached are two photos. The first was taken in the most infested area on April 25th, just after I sprayed. The second was taken this morning (June 4th). As you can see, ALL of the sedges are gone.

It has a self-contained surfactant so there is no need to mix with anything but water.  Put entire packet into a 2 gal. yard sprayer, fill with water, shake, pump up the sprayer and apply.  I live in a beautiful lake villa, directly behind a stone monument entrance sign with halo lighting.  The area was designed and landscaped by a world famous ASLA landscape architect.  However, our association did not know how to manage the sedge grass that annually invades the Blue Rug Juniper planted as an accent.  Unfortunately our friend, neighbor & landscape architect passed away before sedge grass had become a problem, so we were on our own.  I did a lot of research to find your product, Sedgehammer, and tried it for the first time last year.  One application got most of the sedge grass the first year we applied it.  I was actually hoping to see the few remaining blades pop up so they could meet their fate this spring.  There were only six additional outcroppings of 3 blades each.  They were quickly dispatched and we expect no further infestation of this insidious nuisance.  Before Sedgehammer it fell on me to monthly get on my knees and pull all the sedge grass that had sprung up over the past month.  This was a monthly ordeal throughout the spring, summer and into the fall seasons and was not a lot of fun.  Sedgehammer saves a lot of time, is very cost effective, is highly efficient and can be trusted to rid your yard, garden or flower bed of sedge grass.  Also, with few exceptions at a couple of specialty garden supply stores the only place we were able to locate the product has been at Amazon.  Hoping this review helps others with a sedge grass issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

It does not specify how much it has and fingered everyone should know that so they can purchase accordingly!Also by the way cause it does not specify if you know sedge or purple sedge by a different name you can use this on knuckle grass which by me is what we happen to know it by since we are not all professional landscapers or gardeners so of course not everyone knows what the heck sedge grass is!Don't be fooled you can dig around the plant to get up the whole weed but you will need to dig it up as we found out 8"" in diameter around the plant and 18"" down to make sure you get the whole thing and you have to throw away the dirt as you cannot see all the mini tiny little bulbs that you could end up leaving behind for the process to start all over again!  Also to replace the dirt!  You cannot save the dirt once you dig it up!  We were told by professionals that you have to buy dirt that has been freed and cleared of all things so you don't end up with the same issue!So do you need to buy this no you don't, but do you want to have t dig up your whole yard and replace the dirt then reseed and by the time your lawn is back to the way it should be you will end up wasting two years as the roots of need seedlings takes that long to really get down deep into your soil so if you reseed you end up needed to place more down the next year to replace any that might have dies off because not all of them survive and you end you with the same vicious circle every year!

herbs,Chimique,B005BYOIEE,Damien,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2017","Works great! I had a major sedge weed infestation, and this knocked it on the head... but it took time, care and patience. I've seen some folks talking in reviews about unsuccessful sedge management, and figured I'd give some tips from my experience.First up is correctly identifying your weeds. Some onion and garlic weeds look similar to sedge. Ortho will treat both, but (in my experience) it is less effective on sedge weed than Sedgehammer. Much less, actually. Sedgehammer just treats the stuff listed on the label, which is far less broad than Ortho. Get the right herbicide for what you have. Type ""identifying sedge weed"" into your search engine to get some great tips on how its done. Favor the ""edu"" sites over commercial ones.Secondly, make sure you follow the directions. Don't do it when it's about to rain or on a wet lawn. Make sure it's the right amount of time between your mowing schedule. Check the growth of the weeds so that you know it's at the right stage that's printed on the instructions. Make sure your lawn and the weeds aren't under stress (plants tend to go dormant during stress times, meaning it won't ""suck up"" the herbicide). Don't just spray because you have time, get the timing RIGHT.Lastly, be patient. As it says in the instructions, it can take weeks to notice the effect. Dark rings will eventually appear on the sedge, and they will eventually blacken. To help, I've attached some images of how my lawn progressed. I live in Texas, and treated this during the Spring. From start to finish, it was 5 weeks. The photos are pre-treatment, 2 weeks after (the first visible results), 4 weeks after (mostly dead) and 5 weeks after (all dead and drying up).It's now July and some sedge has reappeared, but nowhere near as much (my lawn used to be about 50% sedge weed!). I'll treat again and let you know if there are any issues.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I generally spray the sedge on Tuesday/Wednesday and mow the lawn on the weekend, because apparently you need to let the sedge grow for 2 days after mowing before spraying and then let the SedgeHammer work for two days after application before you mow. It works best when you spray it on sedges that have a couple (3-5) leaves, rather than when its just a single sprout. I've had to do a couple applications because not all the sedges are at the appropriate growth stage at the same time (hence the ""persistence"" in the first sentence). It takes several days before they even start to turn yellow (see ""patience"" above).Also: Due to the bulb-like nature of nutsedge (hence the word ""nut"" in the name), it will probably come back the following summer.

That was about a month ago and im suprised to report that the nutgrass has NOT came back up! This stuff works, and it was easy to use.

I had a fairly large area in my backyard infested with it, as well as a small patch in my front yard. I'd mow the lawn, and the nutsedge would already be visibly taller than the rest of the grass in 24 hours. It also is not controlled by most usual herbicides, like Roundup.Sedgehammer is very easy to use - just mix one packet in a gallon of water in a standard pump sprayer. It took about 5 or 6 days to see results, and in 2 weeks, it was pretty much all dead.See the before and after pics.Note that the area of my lawn that had the nutsedge is now brown, but that's not Sedgehammer's fault.

herbs,Chimique,B003ORSXR8,Smashed,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2015","I used this for the first time today, spraying weeds in my outdoor riding arena and in the gravel driveway.  I used about 10 cc in 3 gallons of spray, and the color showed up enough for me to tell where I'd sprayed. The directions say 6-10 ounces per 100 gallons, so I figured 1 oz/10 gals = 1/3 ounce for 3 gallons.  At about 30 cc per ounce, that came to about 10 cc.  I used an old syringe (farm stores have them) to measure.  I think this product will be fine for doing the spot-spraying for weeds on gravel and sand, but I'm not sure how well the color would show up on a lawn.  I also noticed that it did stain the concrete floor in my garage (I dripped a little...), but others have said it washes off driveways in a few days.  I wouldn't spray on nice concrete without testing it first. I dribbled water on the spots and left it for a couple hours.  The stain is more pale but still visible.  (Oh well.  That stain is nothing compared to the oil stains from the truck!)  For my purposes, it will work fine.  If I want a deeper color, I'll add more dye.  I don't go through enough spray in a summer for volume to be a concern.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
herbs,Chimique,B003ORSXR8,D. Harris,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2021","Used this for a lawn spray indicator. First and foremost, having the ability to measure the product with the little squeeze chamber is critical for a dye like this, and if you look at other indicator products, the most common negative is from staining issues. With this product, I had no issues spilling it on myself, my clothes, or my driveway. Mixed well with a cocktail of ingredients, and provide a nice blue that was definitely easy to see on my mostly-dormant grass. It was almost nice, because the next day it had faded in a bit and combined with the lime green grass just waking up, it almost looked like an early summer green just coming out of winter. Anyway, it does the job you want it to. No, it won't make your lawn look like a smurf, but it's enough of an indicator to show where the spray is landing. Decent value for the amount of product, and definitely the easiest to use of everything available out there.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Chimique,B003ORSXR8,Web Puddin,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2017","I thought this might be a 'luxury' I didn't need. I've been spraying for years without it. Well, for gross spraying - down the edges of the rural driveway and some general areas, I can still do without it. But when spraying ""Cat's Claw"" vine in the woods around my house; when trying to get rid of all the bermuda grass when preparing a new planting bed - or for anything else that requires some finesse and accuracy, this stuff REALLY helps. I find for most of my stuff I can use it about 1/2 strength (& sometimes 1/4)  & save a few bucks. It shows easily on bare ground / dry & dead grass / driveway rocks / and concrete (edge). But it also easily washes off in a day or two of sun and/or rain. Sometimes within a few hours it's hard (at 1/2 strength) to tell where I've sprayed. If vegetation is lush and you're only wanting to spray part of it - use more. It's harder to see on just green vegetation than on surrounding ground, but even at 1/2 strength you can see if you look. I won't use it ALL the time, but I will have it available ALL the time for when it's most helpful.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Chimique,B003ORSXR8,Rob,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2021","Measuring is fantastic. This type of container is the only way to go if you can get it. Used this to mark for herbicides on my lawn. Not as dark as I expected even mixing heavy. I found that at a distance I could see it, kinda like a shadow, but up close looking for the overlap not so much. Still worth using. This was the case when spraying the entire lawn with pre-emergent. For spot use the color stands out much better.  I had no issues with clean up. Overspray on concrete & synthetic fence (not sure of the material but not wood) rinsed right off. Got quite a bit on my thumb when my rubber glove tore, cleaned off pretty good using a fingernail brush and aggressive cleaning, completely off my thumb on the next day.  I use this with: MSO surfactant, 2,4D, XLR8, and Dimension. Mixed fine with any mixing combinations I needed at the time. I have a 2gal backpack sprayer and no issues at all with spray pattern. I did start every mix with about 2/3 water and blue dye first, I always add the MSO last.

herbs,Chimique,B003ORSXR8,A. Rohde,"Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2015","I recommend it for spraying weeds and ants outside, although I don't know that I would trust it to fade if sprayed indoors even though its stated that its safe for that.I read the reviews prior to mixing it the first time and mixed it 1/2oz per 1gal. It was blue, although going from direct sunlight to shade (NM has over 300 cloudless days) it was difficult to tell if I'd sprayed in the shade. Going from shade to sunlight did not cause me to have the same confusion.I went back the next day to finish spraying, and I could tell what I needed to spray still, which was great. All of the blue disappeared eventually, some surfaces took closer to 2 weeks instead of 48 hours.I did mix it once at the 1oz per 1gal and that is very, very blue. It was easy to tell where was sprayed going from direct sunlight to shade and in reverse. At this strength I accidentally misted my shoes (wind shift) which caused faint blue speckles. The speckles have remained for over 2 weeks and don't appear to be fading. As a note, there is a warning that this can possibly stain, and my shoes (Wolverine tan boots with leather upper and manmade sole) definitely resemble that.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

The negative side of the measuring spout is that after measuring the first ounce, you have to look at the fluid from above because you can't see through the plastic. On the plus side: since I have always had problems seeing the fill line through my tank, the die darkens the liquid adequately, making the fill line visible.Another negative with this die: NO MATTER THE GLOVES--somehow, some way, this vibrant blue goo finds its way to your skin.

herbs,Chimique,B00474A4LU,Melissa Rappleye,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2023","The product works, but we did have some issue with it. First, the price for the area it covers is horrendous. You're spending $20 and you'll barely get coverage. We have a partially graveled driveway and this container barely covered the space of three cars. We then bought another container to spray on the rock areas around one side of the house and then the rocks around the shed. It was barely enough. It does start killing some things pretty quickly, but you also have to drench them. Even though I drenched them, there are still areas that didn't die. But it does work fairly well. I would say 80% effective. The huge reason. I was really happy with it though is it was killing my Alaska wild roses. There are a horrible thorny bush here that are really invasive and hard to kill. I bought specific killer for them and it didn't work. I tried this stuff and it killed the bushes. So this stuff really does do a good job but it doesn't cover a huge area.

This spring (2023) I filled up a spray bottle again and made the rounds in the yard, soaking the leaves of a broadleaf lily weed that we have.  (It successfully killed this weed last spring).  I followed directions, sprayed in direct sunlight with no rain in the forecast, thoroughly drenching the leaves.  Did this on several days.  On a couple of the plants, the very tips of the leaves turned brown, but the plants are mostly unaffected.  I an only conclude the jug degraded within a year.

herbs,Chimique,B0149IA526,Jimmy B.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2019","I have a 3/4 acre lawn of hybrid bermuda grass.  Every year I have to deal with crabgrass and other weeds popping up in the lawn.  I needed to give the crabgrass a fairly good soaking with the herbicide, because the liquid would run right off the crabgrass like water off a duck’s back.  This would cause a brown spot in my lawn about the size of a pie plate, until the bermuda grass would recover.  Not anymore!  Mixing Methylated Seed Oil (MSO) with my herbicide allows me to apply much less product to the weed.  It coats the weed nicely and stays on it.  This has multiple benefits.  I use less herbicide, the weed dies quicker, and my lawn has much smaller brown spots in it.  The herbicide/MSO mixture I used was this; In 1 gallon of water mix 1.5 oz of Drive XLR8 (herbicide) and 1 oz of MSO.  This mixture was recommended by a lawn care professional on a Youtube video.  It works great.  You can also substitute MSMA for the herbicide.  This is a selective herbicide that doesn’t harm bermuda lawns.

herbs,Chimique,B0149IA526,Mark Twain,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2018","Makes sense why people buy this.After testing - MSO is definitely more powerful than the same tablespoons of non-ionic surfactant. And with MSO + NIS + herbicide - the herbicide actually works at its rated dose finally.Not sure you can justify the price of MSO though. It would be cheaper to just mix a NIS a bit heavier like 1.5 tablespoons/gallon. If you want to experiment or you’re killing mature weeds like large crab grass - get this. Otherwise meh.Time-LineI’d say plain herbicides take about 7-10+ days to know if they worked. Herbicides + NIS takes 5 days to see results. Herbicides + NIS + MSO saw decent results/trend at 3 & 1/2 days.Very hard to pour compared to the Non-Ionic Surfactant. Currently testing this side by side vs. a surfactant. Comparing Dicamba with MSO vs. Non-Ionic. And 2-4D with MSO vs. Non-Ionic.Non-Ionic is currently much cheaper. Both require 2 teaspoons per gallon. Aka. 0.67 Tablespoons, aka: 1/3 Fl. Oz.On the plus side, MSO is much easier to see where it has been sprayed compared to Non-Ionic Surfactant. You have to know what you're looking for though. You're looking for a glossy wet appearance with a slight orange tint.I'm slightly expecting MSO to damage the grass more in comparison to a Non-Ionic Surfactant. But I'm also hoping it damages the weeds more. The only herbicide MSO is 100% required for is Quinclorac and Crabgrass - for everything else it's just a helper.Currently, Non-Ionic + 2-4D took approx. 2 weeks to kill 50-70% of the weeds",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

It makes the leaves you spray very obvious with a wet, shiny look that helps tell where you have and haven't sprayed.MSO can fill in for a normal non-ionic surfactant, but the opposite is not the case.

herbs,Chimique,B08KH1TRXB,Patrick G,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2021","I’m quite impressed! I’ve used this style of container and electric pump with bug spray so I figured it would be an easier way of killing some weeds and grass. We tried weeding by hand but it took forever and grew back in a few weeks. So I read some reviews and went for this product. Works super well. Some reviews noted it didn’t work in 15 mins like some of the product photos showed. Mine didn’t either. I gave it a day/overnight and the grass I sprayed died. Within two weeks or so the dead grass flopped over and blew away or is barely noticeable.I attached a photo showing my initial test area. I started in one area where the grass was pretty thick on my walkway. So ugly. We have large stones as steps, then some small pebbles between them with dark mulch on either side. You can clearly see where I started and specifically left the upper area alone for comparison. I love it! It killed the grass I sprayed and didn’t discolor the large stones, small stones or mulch. I also sprayed in areas with pine type bushes and it didn’t bother them. I kept it away from flowers but sprayed near the base and they were fine too.I highly recommend. I sprayed each section twice. Nothing overly heavy but “wiggling” it back and forth as I sprayed. Aimed at the base of the grass then the upper “leafs.” Worked better than expected. I used two containers to do a backyard patio with much larger stones and then the front walkway.I don’t know longevity but it’s been 3-4 weeks and in those areas, no grass has come back. I will need to spray a little next year I’m sure when new grass seeds float around but hopefully nothing this bad.Highly recommend!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I also have stepping stones personal walkway.With all that said, I just sprayed patio blocks & everything else during the hottest part of the day & made sure it wasn't going to rain. Needless to say it didn't even take 2 weeks to work. It worked completely within 3 days but I did soak the weeds & things pretty heavily.Nonetheless, the meat & potatoes of it is this stuff for surely works great.

Only problem is, now my grass has so much brown in it because this product killed off so much crabgrass. I bought it for Goosegrass as well and it's killing those as well. A tad slower than the crabgrass, but still working great.I've tried other products for crabgrass in concentrate form and they didn't work half as well as this.

It definitely clears the ground at the correct make down ratios. Everything, and I mean everything, turns brown, dries out and is dead.  But 365 days is laughable, unless they mean until it’s back to full jungle status. Weeds start to pop up again in 8-10 weeks during the spring and summer.  Still the best product I’ve used. Beats Roundup, hands down, for both kill and longevity. I’ll buy it again, because using it three times a year is still way better than pulling by hand.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I prefer the concentrate weed killers because they are a better value and you can customize the mixture depending on the types of weeds you are trying to kill.  This stuff killed the various weeds and overgrown grasses quickly.  There was noticable wilting and discoloration overnight and they were almost fully brown within three days.  Other products that I've used in the past took a week or longer to see noticable results.  This stuff works and is definitely worthy of a five star review.  I'm guessing negative reviewers didn't read the instructions since there is nothing wrong with this product.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Chimique,B001PCRKDC,Robert,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2022","Easy to mix when following directions.Do not use this on a Windy day as instituted or if rain is expected within 24 hours.First application worked great on Creeping Charlie weeds and clovers. Second application worked great on the remaining Broadleaf weeds and Crab Grass. After the two applications and following the directions on container i decided i will be doing a third application just because my yard was neglected for several years and this will ensure i am weed free for overseeing my lawn just before autumn. As to note, Creeping Charlie, Clover and those annoying Broadleaf weeds have no chance against this product. Clover and Creeping Charlie die noticably in a few days. Clover turns white and Creeping Charlie turns brown when dead. You do not need to water your lawn while product is on. Let mother nature do her work and in a week or so you definitely will see the full results. A second application will kill whatever was dormant and may have then grown after the first application. Do not rush anything. Take your time and be happy later with a weed free yard. Follow all directions on container.Also as a tip you Surfactant. It helps the product stick to this pesky Clovers and Crab Grass. I got great results following directions and with the use of Surfactant mixed together.Good luck and stay safe.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
herbs,Chimique,B001PCRKDC,Danrgy/PaulaG,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2017","I ""had"" a terrible speedwell, creeping charlie and violet infestation on my lawn.  Like another reviewer I combined this with Ortho WBG chickweed killer and applied with a sprayer every 10-14 days for 3 applications.  In addition I picked up clippings for 3 mowings as speedwell propagates from readily from  any small clipping as do many other weeds from my readings.  The results are amazing.  After one application they were knocked back but I saw many sprouts popping up. After the second mostly dead and the 3rd application gone.  Weeds die and shrivel up, although it does take a few weeks and the grass is filling in very nicely.  These are hardy weeds and will take some work but when properly applied this does the job.  I have had no grass stress, but it has been somewhat cool and wet.  I will have to spot spray a few spots but overall excellent.  For speedwell regular WBG has almost no affect as many seem to attest.  I tried the WBG Chickweed, Clover and Oxalis killer and it did have some impact but the speedwell came right back.  BTW, this mix also seems to knock out the sedge grass.  32 year home owner and DIY guy.  This stuff works.Be careful and read the directions and measure into your tank sprayer.  This is highly concentrated syrupy consistency, please pay attention to directions, safety and wear gloves, eye protection, mask and long sleeves and pants and shower up right away.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Chimique,B001PCRKDC,Clumzyklutz,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2019","This is first weed killer that we’ve used and actually worked. Our yard was completely green before trying the product, but that’s because it was completely covered by creeping charlie. In the late winter, we still were having to mow every 6 days. After the first application (using the highest amount of recommended ratio of weed killer to water), I didn’t see much of a difference, so I tried it again a week later. Within the next few days after the 2nd application, you could see a drastic change. Now it’s 2 weeks later and the clovers are dead. Our lawn looks dead, but that’s a good thing because it means the creepy charlie was gone and now we can work on building a healthy lawn! As a bonus, an infestation of sticker burs that plagued us was no longer a problem. Our poor dog would come in with so many and they were all over our house. We had too many to pull out one by one. They were in every square inch. This formula killed them as well! We also had poison ivy and other various weeds growing in our bushes. After spraying them, the bushes are fine, but the weeds are completely dead. Now our backyard still has certain types of weeds (crabgrass is one of them) that it didn’t work on, but our biggest issues are gone. I would recommend this to anyone to at least try. Especially if nothing else has worked. One bottle will last us quite a while, so I think the price is worth it!**Side note, I did keep our dog out of the backyard for about 4-5 hours after applying. She is only about 12 pounds, but walked around the entire yard after I let her out and there were no side effects from the treatment.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I applied this product in the morning, took a nap, and woke up to find my lawn looking like it had been on a strict diet and workout regimen. It was like watching one of those time-lapse videos of a caterpillar turning into a butterfly, but for my lawn.2. Covers a large area: I own a pretty large property (don't mean to brag), and this product covered it all. It was like having a magic carpet that could spread over my entire lawn and transform it into a lush, green paradise.3. Rapid and effective weed control: This product showed no mercy to the weeds. It was like a superhero for my lawn, fighting off the evil weeds and restoring peace and tranquility.4. Does not harm lawn grasses: My grass seemed to love this product. It was like a spa treatment for them, leaving them looking refreshed and rejuvenated.5. Cool Weather Performance: This product doesn't care if it's chilly outside. It's like the mailman of lawn care products - neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.Cons:1. Too effective: My lawn now looks so good that it's attracting too much attention. I've had neighbors I've never spoken to before stopping by to ask what my secret is. I've even had a couple of garden gnomes go missing, presumably taken by envious neighbors.2. Rapid results may cause shock: The transformation was so quick that I had a hard time recognizing my own lawn. I had to double-check my address to make sure I hadn't wandered into someone else's property.3. May cause feelings of inadequacy: My lawn now looks so perfect that it's making the rest of my house look bad. I'm now considering a complete home renovation to match the beauty of my lawn.In conclusion, this product works a little too well.

It absolutely decimated weeds in the lawn without causing the slightest bit of damage to the grass. If you follow the label rates and don’t apply when it’s too hot (you can apply in the morning or evening of a hot day) you’ll be fine. This stuff makes a noticeable difference in as little as a few hours. Quickly torches common lawn weeds like dandelion, spurge, clover, thistle, yarrow, etcetera.

The last few years my backyard has been over taken by creeping charlie, clovers, and wild violets. This year I hit a breaking point when I started cutting the lawn and realized something had to give. I did a lot of research online to figure out what to use and I came across this stuff. It's really hard to find something that will kill broadleefs, dandelions, and wont damage your grass. This stuff hit it on every level. I've done two applications so far and just about all of the wild violets, creeping charlie, and clovers are either gone or dwindling to near death! My grass hasn't looked this good in years. The dandelions don't even stand a chance! I had about 15-20 in my front yard and I sprayed each one individually and I'm not even kidding, they we're falling over within 12 hours and didn't even remotely damage the grass.The best part is you can see throughout the neighborhood that the dandelions and wild violets are terrible this year, but you wouldn't know it if you looked at my yard!

I'm generally suspicious of such an absolute endorsement, but he was right on target.It's quite expensive for a 20oz bottle, but it is concentrated. You will need to mix 1oz Speed Zone per gallon of water, as indicated on the product label. (1 oz. = 2 tbls.)I can spot treat my entire lawn (7500 sq. ft.) with only 2 oz of Speed Zone concentrate. So, as it turns out, it is quite economical for my purposes.As far as its effectiveness, this stuff is fantastic. It whacks everything you spray it on EXCEPT your lawn. In my case, cool season grasses - Tall Fescue and Kentucky Bluegrass mixture in Northern Virginia.All this leads me to my next point... Be careful where you spray it!

I wanted to control the grasses next to the lake but as soon as it was dead there was new growth. At this point I would be spraying every week and constantly have half dead grass, which is ridiculous. I can’t think of a need for a product I am constantly reapplying unless it’s for sod preparation so it won’t kill new grass. This is not the reason I bought it. Sure, it’ll kill grass and cattails, but only temporarily and only where it touches, but they will be back, and soon! For such an expensive product I expected more, very disappointed and I won’t be purchasing this again.In the photo, you can see where I sprayed a week ago, everything “died” within 3 days, and it is clearly growing back just fine.",1.0 out of 5 stars,

herbs,Chimique,B0BZR8TLRN,LostInAmazon,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2019","I have great success with Amazon's Southern Ag Atrazine 1 Gallon where Crab Grass, Spurge, Poa Annua & Wild Bermuda is a problem in my Centipede lawn when applied according to label:  * 4.3 oz. per gallon covering 500 sq ft of mix  * No Rain or Irrigation for 72 hours for the contact control to be effective  * Must have water within 7-10 days for pre-emergence to prevent seed germination  * Then be patient - Atrazine takes a few weeks to achieve its full potentialThe treatment will retard the growth of Crab Grass allowing the Centipede to out-grow & squeeze the Crab Grass out, same goes for Bermuda Grass in my Centipede lawn. Fertilizing at the same time (Optimum end of April for me Zone 6) will give the Centipede the edge over the tough to kill weed grasses, just be careful - not too much Nitrogen - apply up to 30-0-10 ratio of slow release twice a year and stay under the 2 pounds per year nitrogen limit for Centipede.  Too much Nitrogen and Centipede will decline.I use a Tractor Supply 15 gallon (three boom) pull behind sprayer which I modified to include a deep cycle battery for power and larger #4 orifice nozzles. The sprayer came equipped with connections to the riding mower, however a riding mower's electrical output is simply not enough, hence the deep cycle battery.  I use 5 ounces Southern Ag Surfactant along with two quarts of Southern Ag Atrazine mixed into the 15 gallons of water. It works great and is applied to approximately 7,500 square feet in very short order.Atrazine controls a wide variety of weeds and Centipede seems to really respond to it, greening up within a few weeks even without fertilizer. If applied according to the label, Atrazine will make a real difference and get rid of your weeds for the season. Please be kind to our environment:  * Read the label, use recommended rates, don’t apply in front of a rain event  * An initial treatment and possibly a follow-up for stubborn weeds like Spurge should work  * Triple rinse & properly dispose of containers",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Chimique,B0BZR8TLRN,Zombie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2017","So this kills Poa Annua (Blue grass). That annoying smelly grass that grows in the middle of the good grass and gets in the way. I have Bermuda grass in my yard (the typical builder grade Bermuda sod installations in north GA). And I read (too late) that this is really meant for St.Augustine and some other specific grass and will kill everything else. Well like I said too late to read this warning as I had already sprayed the front yard with this per recommended dosage on the bottle. After a little bit of panic I watered the lawn to water down the effect of this thing to save my Bermuda from dying, a dire attempt if you will. Low and Behold... it did not kill my bermuda but wiped out Poa Annua completely and any other thing that could have potentially grown in the spring/summer. Well why it did not kill Bermuda.. is a question to ask and will it kill the next time I use it. The answer is yes. It will kill Bermuda BUT not when its dormant or just about to start greening in early spring. Confirmed after a good read on a website that talks in detail about this chemical. So I happened to spray this when the bermuda was just about to start greening or coming out of dormancy. Guess what.. I got lucky with the timing. It did stress the greening parts a little bit so everything looked brown in about two weeks. But then when it started uniformly greening up all the stressed out Bermuda came back right up EXCEPT the annoying Poa Annua. This thing works and is indeed slower. I mean I tried watering it down quiet a bit but it worked despite that. So people who aren't getting results are being too impatient with this weed killer. Let it work for you. I almost felt like I washed the weed killer out after watering down my lawn and thinking that its ok to not kill Poa Annua but save my Bermuda. But it still worked. The next time around I am going to be a little more careful and time it when Bermuda grass is dormant. I am also thinking that this may actually work as a pre-emergent in case if I time it properly and do it early spring.Disclaimer: I wasn't given a product for free. I thought I made a mistake by applying it to Bermuda lawn. But it still worked and it did not kill Bermuda. I think it did not because it was early spring when most of the Bermuda was still dormant or just greening up and Poa Annua was already green and shinning. YMMV. So don't count on my experience a 100%. But it does kill the annoying Poa Annua in 2, 3, or even 4 weeks down from the application date provided there has not been too much rain right after the application.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Chimique,B0BZR8TLRN,Janet,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2014","My yard is mostly bahiagrass, bermudagrass, and weeds, with a little centipede that I am trying to encourage.  This is a very slow-acting weed killer, but it will work eventually.  One application conquered the more delicate  weeds (if there is such a thing) in about a week.  I used two applications about a month apart on most of the yard (about 1/2 acre) and the Atrazine has killed most of the dandeliaons, of which I probably had 75 or more.  It also seems to have slowed the growth of newly sprouted crab grass and some of it is very yellow now, a month after the last application.  I have a lot of newly sprouted crabgrass, however, which I don't expect the Atrazine to take care of.Application is tedious, since you must use a pump-up sprayer, and if you have a large area to cover, it's extremely difficult to keep track of where you've sprayed.  It would be nice if it could be applied with a hose-end sprayer and also to have some kind of coloring to it so that you could tell where you've sprayed.I would buy it again because it's more effective than other weed killers and it does not kill the desired grass as one of the others I tried did, even though it was labeled for centipede.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Chimique,B0C6Q5HPZM,Marc C,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2016","This is AMAZING stuff to use when trying to kill tough vegetation.  I have pachysandra overtaking my woods and flow beds.  I've tried generic glyphosate, which had almost no affect on it, even after applying it 3 times at 2x the dose and waiting over 3 months.  Roundup concentrate was only marginally better (it turned the leaves slightly yellow, but that was about it.)Crossbow is one of the two herbicides that were mixed together to make Agent Orange.  For those of you too young to know what that was, let's just say it made a desert out of the jungles in Vietnam (but also made humans, who were unfortunate enough to be directly exposed to it, into real live monsters).I mixed it at about 6oz/gal.  This is slightly higher than the highest recommended concentration.  I sprayed it liberally onto the pachysandra during the morning in the summer when the sun wasn't shining too hard (that way it has more time to sit on the leaves before it evaporates).  You'll need to do this during the growing season (spring through fall).  It takes about 2-3 weeks before you start seeing the leaves turn brown, but it's all downhill from there.  This seems to be the only stuff I've heard of that can kill pachysandra.Not wanting to take any chances, I bought a decent disposable paint mask and wore rubber gloves while mixing and spraying it.  And so far, I still don't resemble a monster.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
herbs,Chimique,B0C6Q5HPZM,KinoChelovek,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2018","11/3/18:Really good product... depending on your soil type. I use for killing Creepin' Charlie (Ground Ivy).  I have 3 places in 3 different states/climates/soils.  I am using in mid-to-late October and early-to-mid November right now.  I realize that it takes several weeks to show results. The brownish Ohio soil is the best for killing the stuff.  Worked awesome.  Even used 2 days before rain and it rid CC in large test patches.  It has been 2 weeks, since using it in a wider area.  Will post results soon.I used on poor, brownish soil in south central Indiana.  Still awaiting results.I used on black, rich Northern Illinois soil and it is hesitant to work.  Still having poor results.One problem, and it is a biggie, is that it rains a day or two after putting on CC.  This, I know, is not good to do.  I try to put it on 3-4 days before the next rain.  However, midwest rainfall during this time is unpredicable.  Some of the Crossbow may be washing off.  However, it should kill the roots.I put it on my test patches in Ohio and it rained 3 hours later.  Still killed the CC.  It may have been warmer/drier out so it worked better.Illinois: No luck.  Put a second spray on a larger test area and only a little area died.  However, it has only been about a week-and-a-half.I did an entire front yard in Indiana 2 weeks ago.  Haven't checked results.  Being hopeful!Note on product:  STRONG ODOR!  WOW!!!!  Use ingredients correcly.  Use gloves.  Be safe.------12.3.18 Update.Did very well in Ohio, with almost 85% creeping ivy killed off.Northern Illinois:  Had bad weather and early snow that yielded poor results.  I will have to wait until early Spring to try again.  Killed off about 30-35% of area treated.Indiana: 70% killed.  Again, bad weather hindered product working.  Will also have to wait until Spring.------7.17.19 Update.Well, Spring has come and gone.  In Ohio, the creeping charlie ivy was 95% gone from the previously treated areas.  However, it did not do much to the wild violets, that seemed to spread where they were intermeshed with the ivy.  I treated the lawn again in late April and that took care of most of the remaining ivy in those test areas.  I am pretty happy overall with the results there.  I sprayed other parts of the yard that I hadn't before 2 weeks ago.In Northern Illinois.  I haven't retreated the grassy area where the ivy was located.  However, that area is about 60% clear of the creeping charlie ivy that was present last year.  I will treat it when the weather gets cooler.  It has been quite rainy here and that area stayed pretty wet.  I tested this on weeds like poison hemlock (little to no results noted yet) and jewelweed (drooped in hours; browned in days).Indiana - I just did a second treatment this year in my yard.  In the front of that house, I did not spray this year;  the ivy was gone.  GONE.  However, like Ohio, I have violets all over, and this did not even deter them.  I have sprayed the back yard in test places once in early May to test with mixed results (40-50% ivy and some other broadleaf weeds killed).  I treated the entire backyard last week.  Again, the rain there has been unrelenting, but I managed to spray with a 3-4 day break in precipitation.  I will see what happens in 3 weeks.  The earlier spray looked promising on pokeweed (that horrid giant purple berry producing weed!).  It wilted and browned OVERNIGHT!

herbs,Chimique,B0C6Q5HPZM,Roman,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2020","Crossbow isn't Roundup, so that's plus #1.Plus #2 is it's short half-life (3 days) in soil and it's easy application.Plus #3 I haven't found glycophsphates or neoctinoids in it, so I consider it safe for my property is small amounts applied a few days before rain. The half-life is rather long in water, so don't apply within three days if rain if possible. Please correct me if I'm wrong about the neoctinoids, I definitely do not want to harm my bumble bee population.The solution suggested on the bottle (1%) does work well just take quite a bit of time, often near a week. The same rules apply as when using vinegar and soap; spray at the beginning of a warm dry day for best effects.For vines, shrubs and ragweed this systemic killer works well when painted onto an open stem. Are vines invading your flower beds, and you don't want to spray herbicide everywhere, but also don't want to take forever to remove the vines by hand? No problem. Snip a few of the vines, get a cheap paint brush and a paper cup, pour some Crossbow in the cup and paint it onto the snipped ends. Within 1 week everything attached to those vines will be dead and stay that way. It's how I do most of my applications. This stuff also works very well on ivy, both ground level and on trees. I haven't seen my trees suffer, but I've been extremely careful to only paint chopped sections of the ivy vines.In general I'm extremely happy with this product, as long as it's used responsibly.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Lowes and Home Depot just looked at me like I was hallucinating when I told them how 2-4-D worked.  They kept pushing RoundUP and Spectracide's total vegetation killers.  Incredibly, they didn't seem to see any use for a product that might kill poison ivy and dandelions and leave some grass (and other desirable plants like native ferns) living.The only caveat I have for users hoping to kill poison ivy is to pay attention to the directions.  Spraying it only poison ivy once it is completely leafed out is not nearly as effective as spraying it on emerging or even early summer poison.  This doesn't work the same way as total vegetation killers--and that's what sets it apart.  It is a niche product--not intended for all-purpose weed-killing.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

It had very noticeable effect with the weeds shriveling and browning within 2 days - despite receiving tremendous rainfall. The surrounding grass is mostly unaffected. Just MAKE SURE you dilute the concentrate according to the directions (or a bit more dilute) to protect surrounding areas.

herbs,Chimique,B0C6T3VHDY,Mike,"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2023","I use it on my centipede lawn to kill crabgrass and bermuda grass that invade it without harming the centipede. Do not use on fescue. My neighbor saw me killing crabgrass with it, bought some for her fescue yard and killed it. Easy to mix in a sprayer. One ounce product to one ounce of dawn dish washing liquid to one gallon of water. The soap acts as a surfactant. You can buy a separate surfactant but it will cost a lot of money and dawn does the same thing. Just remember to add the water to the sprayer first and then the soap or you will have suds all over. Gently swirl shake the sprayer after filling. The product selectively inhibits photosynthesis so the crabgrass and bermuda grass will turn brown and die. The only downside is this stuff is expensive.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
herbs,Chimique,B0C6T3VHDY,Thanks,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2020","This products works really well to kill  short, growing grass. Grass that has reached a height of more than six inches will usually turn partially purple or yellow and, thou it will probably not die, it will be stunted to the point where the plants you are trying to save will out-grow the grass. This product works very slow, usually taking a week or more to begin showing any results. So don't give up. That's why I write that it is only one tool.

herbs,Chimique,B0C6T3VHDY,Victoria H.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2016","So I applied this shortly after it arrived, about 10 days or two weeks ago. It SORTA worked. It browned out the top sprigs of the homicidal bermudagrass that has taken over the poolside flower garden. Applied it again a few days later, with approximately the same result.This product contains Sethoxydim. It is NOT THE SAME as the old Over-the -Top. The old product really, truly did work on grasses without taking out broad-leafed plants. But it's no longer available...at least, not as Over-the-Top. The new product stinks something fierce: be sure to use disposable gloves when applying, so as not to get it on your hands. Don't apply it on a windy day, and stay out of the overspray.As it happened, a few days ago I decided to clean out the garage cabinets. And what should I find but a years-old squirt bottle of the original Over-the-Top! Instead of Sethoxydim, the original stuff contained fluazifop-p-butyl. Wondering if it still worked, I tried it on the still-vigorous, barely scathed bermudagras. And LO! The old stuff WORKS! As in it really works: the bermudagrass promptly croaked over, and later today or tomorrow I will pull its remains out of the ground.You can still get fluazifop-p-butyl -- apparently it's not one of the effective products that have been taken out of consumers' gummy little hands. It's in Ornamec 170 herbicide...also available on Amazon. Here's a US Forest Service risk assessment of this chemical: [...] Scroll down to page xv for a summary. In brief, risk to humans is fairly low; don't spray it on food crops, don't pour it in ponds, lakes, or streams, and don't saturate the ground with it.

I have used Ortho Nut Sedge Ready to spray, Sedge Ender, Sedge Hammer and finally this.  The Ortho worked well the very first time, but when sprouts came back the following Spring, 2 repeat sprayed failed to do anything.  Then I moved on to Sedge Ender.  The first application killed most of the sedge, but them they all came back 2 weeks later.  Repeated applications of Sedge Ender didn't do anything.  Moving on to Sedge Hammer.  This stuff works slow.  I won't see any change for up to 7-10 days.  Then by the time the old ones are dead, new sprouts came up so I would need to spray the stuff every other week.Then I saw this.  Sprayed it twice and it kills the Sedge within 2-3 days.  This also didn't hurt the bermuda grass I have in the backyard.  Now, it could be that I have different sedge and that's why the other stuff stopped working.

herbs,Chimique,B0753MBFRH,TigerDoc,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2016","I've had a terrible problem with Nutsedge and Virginia Buttonweed that not even a commercial lawn care company could deal with. Buttonweed is extremely pernicious because most herbicides will not kill off the roots, so it always comes back. I tried Weed Free Zone in spot treatment and that killed everything including the grass. So on the recommendation of a local nursery (in South Louisiana), I tried Image. Their recommendation was to use it in +90 degree conditions, which we have every day in the summer. This product works! I have a variety of grasses, including St. Aug, centipede, zoysia, and bermuda. It stunted the growth, but did not kill, all of these, except the bermuda, where it displayed no perceptible impact at all. It took one to two weeks for the weeds to begin showing stress, and three to five weeks for the complete die off, just as the instructions predicted. Also per the instructions, a second treatment of the buttonweed was necessary in some areas. But bottom line, you can use this product on your lawn and still have a lawn left afterwards (assuming proper mix and application).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

No,  its not missed by the lawnmower.  I actually mow that corner 3 times, theres no way it was missed.This took a good couple of weeks to set in.  At first it took about 3 days to see the golding in the lawn leaf.

I have a really horrible red fescue grass, so to see any carpet type look in this type of grass is very rare and absolutely not from natural growth.I do think it's quite expensive.  I'm only going to say that it's worth it if it helps to make the roots grow deeper.

herbs,Chimique,B0C6Q5CB85,BL,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2020","I’m sorry for the bad photo angle, but you get the understanding of what it does to your grass. I just moved into a new home and allied this to 8 month old Bermuda grass. The thicker, short grass is the front yard and where I applied t-nex. The longer, thinner grass is the back yard, with the same number of cuts.In areas of the front yard where I reseeded with higher quality Bermuda, it made the grass so thick that the only comparison I could find is it looks like a fake Christmas tree  limb. It was lush, green, and extremely thick.On the builder grade Bermuda I had varying results. It didn’t keep its green like the higher quality grass, and spotted and turned brown in a lot of areas. I’ve been hitting it with ironite and it seems to be greening up again after a few weeks.My suggestion, read the instructions carefully and if you don’t understand it, YouTube offers multiple channels about how to apply this stuff. For example, for the 1000sqft in my front yard I put 3 teaspoons mixed with 1.5 gallons and it was the perfect spreading rate for me. Next time I will drop to 2 teaspoons to try and not stress the yard as much. This is definitely one of these products where more isn’t better.Lastly, if you have any residue left over in your sprayer - dispose of it properly. I rinsed my sprayer out and dumped it in the yard, and the area I did that in turned more brown than the rest of the yard.Overall I would but this product again, but one gallon is enough for almost 300 treatments for me, so it may be 5 years from now.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Chimique,B0C6T1B3JN,Mishy,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2016","My husband ordered this to make spraying bushes, weeds, etc. easier than carrying a hand pump sprayer. This is so much easier for hands free carrying. However, the one complaint he has is that the lever has to be to pumped over and over again with lots of short pumps. He preferred the battery operated back pack sprayer he had before because it took less pumping because it had a longer cylinder, but the battery wore out after about 4 yrs. So, he thought he'd try this one without the battery. All in all it works well and is more convenient than a hand held sprayer, but it takes more pumping to get it to spray than he would like.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I sprayed on and under all the back yard shrubs (a lot!), and around the perimeter, and except for the heat and humidity, I would have continued on and finished the job in one day.  I bought mine cheaper than Amazon has it, at a big box store, and if I only get one year of use out of it, it is still WAY cheaper than having the mosquito service treat the yard even once!

herbs,Chimique,B0026KTT4U,AlphaGeek,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2015","Great product, however it was different than advertised. Received instead Weed-Out by ferti-lome (which contains Trimec).Was not thrilled to get a different brand of what is advertised on this page. That being said, I gave it a try and it performed wonderfully.Main intent was to get rid of Virginia Buttonweed which was beginning to take over our St. Augustine turf. This is a very hardy weed that is very hard to eradicate. Creeping Charlie was also starting to take hold on other parts of the yard, so this would be a great test to see if this was the product to conquer both.To apply it, I also bought the ""Chapin G362 Professional All Purpose Hose End Sprayer with Metering Dial"", dialed on the ""1"" setting,and was able to treat the front and back yard (~3,000 sq. ft.) with 16 oz of product. I could have used less, perhaps 12 or 13 oz, but on some areas I did go over it more than once since I had some product left on the sprayer's container. The beauty of the G362 is that you could put the product back on the container if there's some left over, as it does not get mixed with water in the container.Applied this at around 83 deg. Instructions say to not apply above 85 deg. Within about two to three days, the Creeping Charlie begin to wither and were completely dead by the end of the week. The Virginia Buttonweed took a about a week to show signs of discoloration, but it was very subtle, so it seemed that it may have beat me =D.I resisted the temptation of reapplying in stronger dose, figuring it probably would take a little longer due to the hardiness of this weed, and was rewarded by an accelerated degradation of the health of the plants two weeks after application. After that, they rapidly begun to wither and ultimately turn black and die (see attached photos).Turf now looks healthy, although it has several patches of yellow throughout, which is the weeds that are dead and not the actual St. Augustine, so I am assuming it will be a few more weeks until the grass covers those voids. I have also bought liquid chelated iron that I've just applied yesterday to help the lawn get greener quicker. I'll try to update this review in a couple of weeks to convey results.This is definitely no my area of expertise, so it's sheer happenstance that I was able to nail my weed treatment on the first try.

I have an easement that was over-run with Creeping Charlie.  I used about double the concentration recommended and after two applications, all of the Creeping Charlie was gone.  I’ve used the proper mixture in the yard over the summer and it kills most of the weeds and the grass looks the best it has in a long time.  Violets still come back, but this will weaken them and keep them from spreading as much if left untreated.  It might even kill them with continued application every week.  I did not have any burn issues and the grass has been fine with about 3 applications over the course of two months using a hand-held sprayer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Chimique,B0026KTT4U,Daniel,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2021","OK folks a couple of things. YOU NEED SURFACTANT for this to work.

If your lawn is 10000sqft you will need 10 gallons of water with 5oz-20oz mixed in the water.If you don't want to go through the hassle 1.5oz per gallon will kill weeds once you hit the 2.0oz+ per gallon the likely hood of killing grass is EXTREMELY high.Finally, surfactant is an agent that makes herbicide stick to plants. Some people use crop oil, kerosene etc. YOU NEED surfactant with Trimec. 2.0oz of surfactant per 4 gallons works. Rad the label as different herbicides need more surfactant.

herbs,Chimique,B0026KTT4U,Charles,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2014","Purchased the Trimec weed killer specifically to eradicate bindweed or morning glory yard vine.  I live in North Texas and this weed has taken over the neighborhood.  It is not a patch that can be topically treated with roundup but invasive and runs over most of the yard.  With Texas summer drought, yard grass can't compete but the bindweed has no problem killing everything as it grows on top of the grass.  Received the Trimec and a Gilmore 362 sprayer and tried it out.  Instructions on the container were not very clear to me so I just tried a setting of ""2"" on the Gilmore sprayer and applied over a section of the yard.  The next day the bindweed with the small white flowers disappeared, and by the end of the week the vine looked wilted.  Trimec did not harm the St. Augustine grass only had to be careful of shrubs and tree drip lines and not spray in those areas.  Highly recommend this stuff as I had asked local nurseries and they did not have a clue.  A Gallon will treat a very large yard front & back.",5.0 out of 5 stars,

herbs,Chimique,B000WMPF1A,Monica P,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2017","This stuff is very effective against buttercup and a variety of other broad-leaf plants. I have been completely overrun by buttercup, as in there is an entire 1/4 acre of my property that had not a single blade of grass because it was all buttercup. I also have bindweed. (I was thinking maybe I should just move lol) I was looking for something to kill the weeds but keep what I had left of my grass, so I tried the 2,4-d. For a few days after spraying it looked like nothing was happening, and then the buttercup started to wilt. And then it progressively withered away, with the stalks becoming soft and mushy, until it withered away into basically nothing. I didn't even have to pull up any of the dead stuff, it just kind of disintegrated in a very satisfying way. This took about a week or two, so it was a slow but a very complete death. There were some patches of buttercup in the very thick patches that made it through the wilting stage and then perked back up (I'm guessing they didn't get saturated enough because they were protected by more buttercup) so I sprayed those a second time and that did the trick. So that 1/4 acre of buttercup became 1/4 acre of dirt since there was nothing else growing there, but it's been about a year and the grass has come back, with the buttercup gone. Everywhere else that I still had grass, the 2,4-d killed the weeds but not the grass. It's not impossible to kill grass too, but you have to be very heavy-handed with it. You can apply this stuff pretty liberally without affecting the grass at all.For my bindweed, this stuff was ok as a deterrent but not great at killing it. It would make the bindweed wilt and I would have to keep re-spraying it every 2-3 days to kill it, however it would just come back. I found that Triclopyr is very effective against bindweed though, so mixing that into the 2,4-d would be great if you have a bindweed in addition to other weeds. The 2,4-d has been great at killing dandelions, chickweed, and most everything else that's been taunting me.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Yes, you will have to inflate the tires with a bicycle pump to 30psi. The metal structure is thick and the very sharp aeration blades are made of stainless steel. Assembly was lengthy in time. About 2 hours using small electric impact. I found myself referencing the hardware guide often to verify correct fastener selection. There are at least two confusing assembly steps as the drawings were not detailed enough. I used the aerator immediately after assembly as it just finished raining (to soften soil). I placed two concrete blocks and one bag of sand on the tray. I towed the aerator with a typical 42 inch lawn tractor and went over the yard twice with great results.

herbs,Chimique,B0C8HVYVCC,Ben W.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2022","This product works as advertised. You definitely need the extra weight / cement blocks to get maximum penetration into the soil.Assembly was fairly easy as they produce a video on YouTube with the step by step directions.  Even so, there is a point, when installing the next to the last bolt for the wheel lever, I encountered a problem. The 1 1/4"" bolt is too long to fit in the space that is provided, however, a 1"" bolt fits just fine. I believe, early on in the instructions, where you are instructed to install the very first 1"" spacer on the axle, I believe if the 1 1/3"" spacer is installed instead, then the 1 1/4"" bolt would fit. And in place of the first 1 1/3"" spacer, you install the 1"" spacer instead. Since that part of the assembly is very near to the beginning, I didn't go back and try it.  Nonetheless, I was able to finish the assembly by substituting a 1"" bolt near the end.Even with that complication, I still give 5 stars as it looks like I'll be getting many years of good use out of this product.Addendum: After reading someone else's review about a couple of bolts through the tray that appear to have no purpose. I would leave them installed as they serve to keep any weights that you add from sliding into the wheel lift lever.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

There are one or two parts that require re-reading and comparing the diagram. And the final step is the worst bur... It says so right in the manual. Wear gloves! I slipped a few times while tightening things and smacked a spike which drew skin and blood.I tossed a few heavy stepping stones and a bag or two of soil on top and pulled it behind my mower. Just go slow and watch it work. Plugs out real nice. Especially if you get a good full day or two of rain beforehand.Only downside is that I don't see any way to really disengage the spikes. Like if I wanted to pull it across the driveway or up the street to a neighbors. Not sure if it's design or my assembly but the spikes do not fully leave the ground when I lift the lever.

herbs,Chimique,B0C8HVYVCC,Giles Habibula,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2020","Let's get right to the DOWN side.  I was an aircraft mechanic and electrician in the Navy for 20 years: It took me 2 hours to put together.  I had to back up & disassemble a previous assembly step at some point during the assembly of the aerator tines onto the rotating shaft, 3 times, to correct something I overlooked because there are a LOT of parts that go together in a complicated sequence.  I can't blame it all on the Directions (I read them VERY carefully) but it's got a LOT of parts and nothing is preassembled. You MUST have a very complete set of tools to tackle this thing. NOTE: there is a clevis pin and key to hold the control handle together in addition to the pivot bolt and lock nut - I have no idea why the clevis pin is there instead of a bolt.  NOTE: Don't overtighten the wheel bolt jam nuts against the wheel hubs.  NOTE: Don't forget the plastic 'bearing inserts' in the ends of your tine tubes.Now for the UP side:  It WORKS, it WORKS, it WORKS!!  It's WELL made (HEAVY GAUGE SOLID STEEL) and should last for YEARS even after loaning out to your neighbors. (Rental?) My Toro Riding Lawn Mower pulled it without ANY trouble. This $150 SAVED me $1000 for a Lawn Service contract per year.  Remember, aerating is the hardest part of a Spring Yard Prep.  The fertilizer, lime, and seed are a snap beside the aeration.

herbs,Chimique,B0C8HVYVCC,Apsurf,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2020",A) The aerator is very sturdy.  I used two 70# sand bags in the tray and It was no issue until I needed to lift the tunes to engage the wheels ; you need separate weights on either side of the lift handle.B) the only issue was the assembly instructions were not entirely accurate. I wrote my “lessons learned” during assembly and shared them with a friend when he assembled the same unit. Maybe you’ll find these helpful.  Agri-fab should update the instructions.1) Tools required for Assembly: add Combination square or anything you can use to square the sides in step 102) no step 10 you say!  See #33) starting with the bullet beneath the Caution on page 4 number all the bullets into steps.  Should end up with 17 steps.4) in step 6 it says “do not tighten until step 8” change to “do not tighten until step 10”.5) step 7a) Last instruction says “Tighten” but don’t tighten until step 8b) it shows (4) 3/8 x 1 hex bolts installed in line in the tray.  Don’t install the center 2 of these until step 15; these attach the wheel shaft center brace to the tray in Step 16.  The left photo above shows those 2 cemetery holes after attaching the wheel bracket.6) in step 8 it uses four 3/8 x 1-1/4 hex bolts.  I could only use 2 at the ends.  The center 2 could not be used: there are no holes for this. In the Middle picture above you can see 2 holes (1 slotted) on the left but there are no holes in the tray7) Step 10: this is where I used the square to make sure the end plate is perpendicular.  Had to suspend the end of the tray over the work table to get to both sides of the bolt/nut.8) Step 16: uses two 3/8 x 1-1/4 hex bolts to attach wheel bracket to lift handle. There is not enough clearance to attach the bolt that is closer to the wheel shaft: the aerator spike and attaching plate are in the way.  This is the picture to the right.  I cut the bolt shorter.  Attached the nut on the bolt and cut it with reciprocating saw then backed off the nut to make sure the threads were not damaged while cutting.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I recommend you get the Agri Fab assembly video off of Y outube and sit on the floor assembling while watching the video on a laptop, worked well.  When the instructions tell you not to tighten a bolt, don't do it or you'll have to undo it several steps down the road.  When you get to the end where you are bolting on the engagement handle and adjusting it, it will be an ah hah moment why you left the bolts loose.  You wiggle around the top table and supports to get a good fit and engagement for the handle and then tighten the specified bolts.I went to home depot and got (3) 16"" x 12"" x 8"" cinder blocks for weight, they fit nicely.

But I couldn't wait to tell you about building it. I'm the kind of guy, I can look at something and build it in a fraction of the time without even looking at the instructions and I get it right. This thing.... 4.5 hrs of work to put it together. It's heavy, the parts are heavy and you will get cut and bleed from the blades no matter how careful you are. That's the con. Here's the pro, you want this to be heavy and sharp, that's the point, it needs to dig holes and do it fast. So don't be a whimp and get to it. Sweat, smell like grease and metal for 4.5hrs (if your good) otherwise expect longer. It's like putting together that swing set you made for your kids in the backyard, you thought it was simple but it took you two weekends to complete. This is like a mini version of that.There is one true complaint I do have. There's a mount you need to slide smack in the middle of the axel. Well it ain't going there. Nope I mean it. You'll be cruising along, saying to yourself, that dudes a troll I'm kicking ass on this build, then you'll get to the mount that has to slide on the shaft and after about an hr of swearing and pacing you'll have two choices, put this pie hole of a metal contraption back in the box and send it back or... put a grinder on your drill and spend another hour grinding out paint and metal from inside the mount to get it to slide down the shaft. That's the extra two hours. If you read this I just saved you an extra hr of standing there thinking this can't be right, well it is, get over it and have your grinder ready to ream out the hole so the mount slides on. By then you'll probably have about two cuts on your fingers.Once you get past that point your almost done. Only 1.5hrs left. Everything is a lock bolt, so you'll need every Damn ratchet you have to hold both sides. It's going to be like wack a mole from this point forward. Can you swing that ratchet back and forth without slicing your fingers down on the blades? I call that entertainment and this thing gives you the sense of feeling alive.

First off, make sure you have a decent tool set. I consider myself to be mechanically inclined. I’m 42 years old I’m a ASE master technician and a Toyota master technician. I thought it would take an hour, maybe an hour and a half to put this thing together. It took almost 3… My irritation started when they shorted me a nut for the carriage bolts, which I had to purchase later at a hardware store. There are bolts that are instructed to be inserted and tighten that fasten nothing. A bolt that has to be substituted for a shorter bolt in order to be able to fit between one of the inner spools and the lift handle, to secure the lift handle to the inner wheel bracket. I had remove the lift handle after installing it and place it in a vice to bend it because it was dangerously close to slipping out of the recess notch which locks the wheels in the down position. Four extra washers that are not stated to be installed anywhere in the instructions.. and then I had to sharpen the blades after dulling them on my garage floor while wrestling with this thing during assembly. All in all it seems like a decent product but you will need to bring your tools including sockets larger than you may have at your home and you will definitely need to bring your patience.

It took about 2 hours to assemble at a leisurely pace while being careful not to cut myself on the sharp blades. You will need various SAE wrenches and sockets. Also, there are several steps that will require a second person to help. Unfortunately, it was missing the nylon lock nut to attach the last wheel {sigh} so I went to the hardware store and purchased a similar nut to get me by. I entered a support request on the website and the nut arrived in 3 days by mail.I used 4 cinder blocks to weigh down the aerator.

I have used several times and it is sturdy enough that will get plenty of seasons out of. Great plugs in the yard for aeration and overseeding. Reason for 4 stars and not 5, is because the cinder blocks don't fit perfectly for whatever reason, I kind of have to cockeye them.Also, be sure your mower can handle the weight, I have to use 3 blocks not 4 else my mower struggles to pull with tines lowered. I am sure I am part to blame, as I am adding 250lbs plus on the tractor seat LOL.I believe I was given the wrong part, after putting this together, no matter where I place the lever, the tines are the same height, and will not penetrate the soil. I contacted Agri-Fab via the website asking if i could have been given the wrong part, as it seems my lever is not the one shown in the picture. I am waiting to hear from them. Hopefully they will be able to help me, I was hoping to be able to use this for years, for the price, it is well constructed, if i can get 5 years plus out of it, the cost certainly saved me versus renting one.

I debated the 48” vs 40” and glad I went with the smaller unit. This saved me about $80 and some storage space ongoing. The 40” unit is already just over 50” wide at the wheels, so the larger unit could be expected to be almost 5’ wide.Like several other reviews, it took me just over 2 hours to assemble by myself. I’m a retired engineer, so fairly handy with tools. The instructions aren’t great. I laid out all the parts and tools first and made sure everything was there. They even gave me one extra carriage bolt for the knives.You need to pay attention to the orientation of the wheel brackets to be sure both are facing the same direction and the the center wheel bracket is in the opposite direction. You can see this on the assembly instructions but it is not obvious. Wear gloves to protect against knicks and knuckle busters. I wore a pair of rubberized nylon gloves that gave me good dexterity and had no injuries.I had one assembly issue and that is the 3/4 flat washers. They provide 8, but I only see where 4 are called out in the instructions. I can see where others could be used, but did not install them.In operating the unit, I pulled it behind my 48” Husqvarna with 24HP and had no real issue except loss of traction going up a wet red clay hill. Backing the aerator is a challenge. The unit would be much better if knives were spaced closer and there were more of them. Multiple passes are required due to the wide spacing and then you trample over the plugs making a muddy mess. Also the wheel lift lever does not want to stay in the up position, but they do give you two raised bolts to attach a short bungee to assist.If the unit had more knives with closer spacing, I would rate it 5 stars, but can give it only 3 due to need for multiple passes.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Fortunately, it was during the initial assembly of the blades, which is the first part of putting the aerator together.  I put the entire blade assembly together, but noticed the bar that held the blades didn't have enough room for anything else, especially the wheels. So, I thought I assembled the parts wrong and disassembled everything thing. After carefully reassembling everything again, I had the same issue. The bar appeared to be to short, missaligned or something.  This entire process, at this point had already taken about 1 hour and a half oor so. Once I couldn't figure it out, I contacted the manufacturer. After speaking with customer service, it appeared they knew about a defective part that was in the box. The defective part was the bar that the blades went on. Apparently, the center hole was improperly drilled and caused a space issue.  The customer service representative was very helpful and told me they would send me out a new bar. They did and it arrived in a few days. Once I recieved the bar I immediately began assembling the aerator.  Unfortunately, after another 1 hour and a half, right when I got to the last bolt, I noticed the bolt was missing! I couldn't believe it! I had to wait until the next day to go Lowe's to get bolt.  What was hard for me to believe, was that this manufacturer actually sent out a defective unit with good quality control. I will wait to write an additional review after using the aerator. Make sure you check out the videos for the assembly. It's a bit tricky!  UPDATE: The aerator itself worked great! Very sturdy product that should last years to come.

Take 5 min to separate your parts into their respective groups on pieces of paper labeled by part number.  Trust me, you'll be glad you did.

If it were not for the worst packing I have ever received it would have rated it 5 stars. The fact all of the hardware was still in the bags is a miracle, the box arrived with the top front torn completely away (about 6"" X 8"") The Box was from the manufacturer-not an Amazon box. All of the major machine parts were loose in the box and the tong was the part that had slid around and ripped off the top of the box. The heavy spike assemblies were also loose and had slid around inside the box impaling both of the otherwise heavy duty plastic bags of hardware. The fact that the spikes were still in the bags may have prevented the loss of nuts and bolts. I can easily see why other reviewers reported missing hardware. The other result was dozens of scratches in the paint on the other parts. If this had normal cardboard separators or Styrofoam molding to hold the big parts in place this would have been a glowing review and a top notch product.

Just take it slow and try to avoid sharp turns and hard objects. My only 2 complaints are I wish I could reach the handle from my seat and I had one of the parts that hold the tines on break. My fault I hit a tree root while making a sharp turn. Both things you should avoid with it. It could have been welded on better.

Found this one after some research and bought it. To my surprise, it was waiting on me bright and early on Sat. morning which gave me time to put it together and then put it to use.The instructions were pretty straight forward which made assembly an easy but time-consuming process. If you aren't good at putting things together, this may be a tough one to get through. Once the assembly was complete, with no extra parts lying around, I found the aerator to be really solid and was impressed with the quality of the materials. It's going to last me for years.The actual performance of the aerator was impressive as the steel pluggers dug nice and deep with 140 lbs of weight on the platform.

One of the aerator knife mount plates wasn't welded perpendicularly with the axle but it doesn't seem to affect performance. This wasn't too difficult to assemble but it did take about two hours. I think there were a few mistakes in the directions, specifying to tighten bolts that should have been installed/tightened at a later step for attaching the mid-axle support bracket to the tray. Also the aerator knives are quite sharp (as they should be). It would be worthwhile to wear gloves and take care of working over the knife assembly during the final steps with the aerator turned on its back, especially when forcing that final bolt for the wheel lever attachment into place.

herbs,Chimique,B0C8HVYVCC,Norse,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2022","This is a badly engineered aerator, if engineered at all.It took over 4 hours to correctly put together with all the different parts and bolts.After double checking with the supplied manual, the handle was offset and would not engage in hinge to keep wheels up.  Also, you have to get off the tractor to move the handle.I solved both problems with a rope attached to the handle that I could pull and keep pulled to lift the wheels and aerator spokes.  The spokes are extremely sharp.  I got cut several times while assembling all the bolts and nuts.  Also, the aerators are attached to a metal plate that is only welded 1/2 the way around the plate.  The spacers are plastic and I expect to wear quickly.  Overall, very flimsy.  I had two cement block weights on top tied down with zip cords that worked fine after the yard was softened by rain.  I would not use this on a dry yard in that it probably would not stand up and work well given flimsy design.

The spool goes over the wheel shaft and the spots where the spools connect to the shaft are poorly welded. It's only spot welded in places, and the first time I used it one of those welds broke. At that point you're dead in the water. If you keep using it you will tear up the entire thing. I'm having to get a replacement spool sent to me, but I'm also going to have to dismantle the entire thing and take the other spools off, remove the tines, and get them welded correctly.

The weeds would  grow back way before the lawn needed cutting .making the yard look like it needs to be mowed again. How we did it was , we sprayed the leaves on the weeds , the day before we cut the lawn. Giving the weed killer 24 hours to work. Then the next day we cut the lawn. But in my back yard i cut the small lawn FIRST. Then i sprayed all up and down the grass because the back lawn looked like it had more clover like leaves then grass. Plus the vines were growing between the fence. Ipulled vines and sprayed good. It's three weeks later and the back yard is still real low. Minus the growing vines.

herbs,Chimique,B00X2YO75K,M. J. Lang,"Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2016","We keep a chemical-free lawn, which means we tolerate a lot of miscellaneous species in our grass.  However, when Creeping Charlie began a death march across the front yard, we simply couldn't hand pull it fast enough.  Where we live, Creeping Charlie chokes out and kills everything beneath it, so we had to temporarily compromise our environmental principles and move to more drastic measures to kill it off and win back the lawn to replant with a grass or ground cover more hardy.  I was highly skeptical of the selective nature of this herbicide, but in general it worked as advertised.  After one application, the majority of the Creeping Charlie began to die back.  It wasn't instant, took about 2 weeks for most of it to brown and wither.  Another application was needed to address whatever was left.  Other ""weed"" ground cover mixed in the lawn also died back (clovers, etc.), but the law grass appears to be unaffected at all and desirable border plants that were sprayed seem to be doing OK (vinka, lamimum, yarrow...).  Ours was a massive and aggressive infestation, and the Bonide chemical made it practical to recover the yard without gutting everything down to the soil. We've got a substantial ""scar"" to repair where the Charlie had taken over, but it's an easier and cheaper fix than it might have been without this chemical intervention.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
herbs,Chimique,B00X2YO75K,jimmunology,"Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023","Oxalis is a major PITA to treat.  It spreads incredibly fast and the usual selective pesticides are completely ineffective.  If you have a thin lawn in a heavily shaded yard like mine and use a lot of moss killer like me, this weed can be a real scourge.I've used this specialized Bonide product and the Ortho Weed B-gon Chickweed, Clover & Oxalis Killer.  Basically, they both have triclopyr, but this product also contains 2,4-D and dicamba.  The concentration of triclopyr is a lot less than what's in the Ortho product, but perhaps the other two drugs make up for that.Both of these products seem to work, but are harsh on the lawn, perhaps Ortho a bit more so.  I used 1.5 oz per gallon for the Bonide, and 1 oz per gallon for the Ortho.  I also added about a half tablespoon of Bonide Turbo surfactant to each gallon to improve sticking.  To treat a full scale infestation, I covered the entire lawn.  Not much seems to happen over the next two weeks save the weeds slowing down a bit.  After a second treatment, they finally slowly start to turn white and die.  However, the lawn slows down during this time too.  In the past, I've applied too much of the Ortho stuff and killed my lawn, so you have to be careful not to overdo it.The two treatments take care of about 80% of the weeds, but because of the toxicity, I would definitely not do a third treatment.  Instead, I spot treat any surviving weeds for the next few weeks and then continually spot treat or pull out any new weeds that pop up.  Because they seed so efficiently, you really have to be complete with your eradication and then be vigilant forever to prevent another infestation from occurring.It's a grueling war, but I think it's a bad idea to do full treatments annually because your lawn would never grow to its full potential.  Once you get the upper hand though, it gets easier.  I'm holding out hope for a better pesticide to arrive someday, but until then, this seems to be the best that we have to work with.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

As soon as I see those pesky critters I spread more Preen. Preen DOES NOT kill weeds. It kills the seeds.If you do your flower beds correctly it lasts six months or more. I did two large flower beds at my daughter's house and didn't see a single weed for over a year!Start a new bed by pulling every weed or blade of grass. (Yes, a lot of work, but it will save tons of weeding later.) Then scatter Preen on the bare dirt. Lay your landscaping fabric. (Use a high quality fabric) Cut X slits and plant your plants. Spread mulch and scatter another layer of Preen on mulch and water in thoroughly. Every month or so scatter Preen around the perimeter of the flower garden. You won't see weeds. If you do, it's time for more Preen. Pull the weed and scatter again. Eventually you will see very few weeds.I once read a blog by a gardener who said no weed is too small to pull.

herbs,Chimique,B07JYFJVFL,Christopher Phan,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2020",I like this product!! Is it 100% weed proof? no. More like 95% since some of the weeds that come up are already established. It helps to pull the weeds at the root and then use Preen. Follow the instructions. You MUST water after spreading. This keeps the weeds at bay. I can pull the 2-3 weeds we get on a weekly basis and maintain our yard. I would recommend getting more than you think you need. We will definitely get more next season!UPDATE: We bought this again (larger bag) this season and so far have not seen any weeds come through and it has been 3 weeks,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Chimique,B00KWY6RZ6,Daniel,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2021","OK folks a couple of things. YOU NEED SURFACTANT for this to work. The amount of Trimec is based on volume per 1000sqft. So if you have 4 gallons and it takes a gallon of water to spray 1000sqft you then can use .5oz-2.0 oz per gallon.  If your lawn is 10000sqft you will need 10 gallons of water with 5oz-20oz mixed in the water.If you don't want to go through the hassle 1.5oz per gallon will kill weeds once you hit the 2.0oz+ per gallon the likely hood of killing grass is EXTREMELY high.Finally, surfactant is an agent that makes herbicide stick to plants. Some people use crop oil, kerosene etc. YOU NEED surfactant with Trimec. 2.0oz of surfactant per 4 gallons works. Rad the label as different herbicides need more surfactant.

herbs,Chimique,B00OINUYA6,James Anderson,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2020","I live in ""Goathead Country"".  (If you don't know what those are, count yourself VERY fortunate!)  This weed almost seems to come in two forms: ground cover and something that looks like wild grass.  Regardless, both let you know when they come in contact with a body part -- very memorable!  I used Round-Up in the past, but stopped due to rumors of it causing cancer in lab rats or something.  Anyway, Spectracide may be found to do the same one day, but until then, it totally gets my vote as being just as good or better than Round-Up.For those who don't find it successful, I have two tips that make my weed hunts more effective:1. They may say it is rain safe in a few hours but I prefer to give it a day, assuming I spray in the morning.2. Like hunting, morning and evening when the sun isn't a factor is best.  I had a guy tell me hitting them early morning is best because weeds have some kind of protective ""enzyme"" that gets stronger as the sun comes out and it gets hotter -- sort of a protective mechanism, I guess.I find if I spray at sunrise and it doesn't rain all day, I can see evidence of wilting the next day in many cases.  Within 5 days, they are brown.  I know Round-Up used to have the commercial that showed weeds wilting, disintegrating, then blowing away in the wind like dust -- never happened for me!  Real world was them turning brown and me pulling out the dead carcass.  Regardless, this stuff is effective on everything!Results will vary, but I attached a same day pic taken the afternoon after I sprayed that morning.

I did not want pre-mixed, I prefer the concentrate.Our yard and grounds have a lot of gravel and driveway, which tends to sprout weeds. I have used at least three different weed & grass killers, and this is by far the best as well as economical and fairly easy to use. I use a two-gallon hand sprayer (purchased from Amazon!), and follow the label directions for mixing. The type of weed & grass killer I am using in the interim requires more than twice as much concentrate in the mixture.

Apparently, whoever wrote the instructions wanted to make the product look more attractive to the potential buyers rather than honestly explaining what and how it does. You should completely ignore a few statements on the label, particularly about the ""normal"" as opposed to the ""best results"" amount to use, and about how fast the results show up. Here's what you need to do:1. Use 7 ounces per gallon of water (which is advertised as ""best""). Do not use less than that!2. Wait at least 24 hours to see the signs of grass and weeds dying. It will not happen any sooner!3. After 2 days the grass and weeds will actually look dead. Not after a few hours!4. I do not know why, but it works slower in the shade - you may need to wait 2-2.5 days to see visible results in shady areas.If you ignore the misleading description provided by the manufacturer, you will see that it actually kills even tough weeds, although some of those may require a second application.

I'm no botanist or even amateur gardener and can't tell you what kinds of plants this killed... But the context was we had a bunch of different varieties of spikey-vines, grass breaking through gravel, and what looked like several species of clover-style weeds all growing fast after monsoon season rains. This melted them all. Within an hour and a half, they were all dark brown, clumped flat like wet tissue paper.I'd been slowly losing the weekly whole-yard hand-weeding battle and was at the point of needing something to kill off the blooming weeds en masse to get control back. I mixed this with a longer-lasting ground coverage type product (to ensure the weeds this product nuked don't return).

It browned the grass quickly...VERY quickly but now I have new growth on every part of the lawn sprayed...and I mixed int on the strong side.  The Compare N Save and HDX are is still dead...took much longer but killed to the root!  Spectracide DID NOT kill to the root and all the grass area to be killed off...90% has grown back.Product did not work for me as I hoped it would.  If your looking for a quick brown...this is your product but it did not kill the lawn to the root in the areas desired.  I have Floratam St Augustine which is a rather sensitive and many weed and feeds will kill it off...so I totally expected this to work completely....and it did not.Wasted money...at least it was on sale.  Going back to Compare N Save and/or HDX.So far this appears to be one of the best products I have used (based on the visual appears of grass/weeds being dead).I am doing a complete yard renovation and the backyard is approximately 12,000 sqft.  I have used HDX brand and Compare and Save brand grass/weed killer.  I used both individually in applications in areas of the back yard, and  mixed them both with a surfactant into one application.  In all of the cases I used a few ounces over the strongest recommendation.  It took about 3-4 days to start yellowing and about 10 days to get to brown.  To be fair it did rained a few hours after some of the applications, but the product still worked very well.  In most cases plenty of sun light was present, live in Central FL, and temp was low 90s to mid 80s.Spectracide was MUCH quicker....how much...damn near instant!  I sprayed about maybe a 2000 sqft area finishing about 2pm ish (just in time to watch the Canes whoop up on the Noles).  Visible discoloration in probably 2-3 hours.  By Sunday same time the grass was almost as brown as the grass sprayed almost two weeks early.  Yes, in about 24hrs!  Everything is brown...St Augustine grass and all the weeds in it.  Maybe 3-4 spots that have a slight hit of green...which may just be what I missed spraying.  This appears to be the real deal.  I hope it truly does kill to the root.

herbs,Chimique,B00OINUYA6,S. Powell,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2017","Several people have compared Spectracide Weed and Grass Killer to Glyphosate (trade name Roundup).  IMO they are comparing apples and oranges, as these are complementary products that happen to work differently, but each have their strengths.  To wit:- Spectracide is a ""foliage burner"" i.e. it burns back whatever green foliage you spray it on, but does not go after the roots to the extent that roundup does.  This makes it ideal for spraying the ""runners"" that my hybrid Bermuda lawn sends out into the flower beds next to the lawn.  It kills those without affecting the parts of the Bermuda plant that stay on the lawn.  And it does it quickly, turning them brown within a day or so.- Glyphosate works by inhibiting the formation of certain plant proteins; this process takes longer (up to a week or more during cool months, or days during the warmer actively-growing summer months) but it kills the entire plant including roots.  Furthermore you don't have to cover the entire plant for it to absorb enough herbicide to completely kill the plant.  That makes it ideal for spraying some of the hardier, more ""shrubby"" plants that grow around our property.Taken together (note: not applied together) these two herbicides provide the complete solution to my weed-control needs.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

More sensitive weeds will die quicker. I use this mostly on cracks in driveways & sidewalks. I also use this to spot spray tough weeds in lawns. I mix 3fl oz in a 1 gallon sprayer & it goes a long way. DO NOT spray this all over the yard unless you are replanting everything. This will kill any plant it touches.

This spray did extremely well. The chickweed and clover just exploded in one week.  This makes it difficult for the Bermuda to really come out at it's best when mid May comes.  This should really give it a head start.  Best week killer I have ever used.  It has not rained in a week and this is 6 days after application.  It is killing the chickweed, clover and onions.

If you use it twice in a short time well duh!!! its going to kill your grass.  Use as directed and it worked well for me.  I am going to spray once more early this spring and probably again in early June.  All the lawn services say that spraying is better.  With the drop spreader stuff I would wet the grass and also spray it with dawn to hold it on the leaf, didn't work even with overlapping spreads.

herbs,Chimique,B07YM5354K,Metcalf,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2023","This product was recommended by a friend who has a nice lawn.  He said that it did a good job of killing weeds at his place.  My back yard, here in Texas, is all Bermuda and is strong and thick.  However, there is one area in which an infestation of some kind of a small-leaf clover has begun to grow enough so that it looks poised to crowd out the grass.  My experience with weed killers that claimed not to damage grass has not been good, so I did not hold out great expectations for this one.  To my surprise, though, it has done a very good job of killing most of the clover as well as a few other assorted weeds.  There is still a bit of clover left which does not (fortunately) look healthy, so I will be making a second application.  Some of the grass did lose a bit of its nice green in favor of a more yellow tone, but it was a small amount of grass and it seems to be coming back nicely.  Even though I plan a second application, it has done what it said it would.Two small chinks in the Score:  First, the hose connects to the bottle and when the water is turned on, it pulls the weed killer out into the water stream with it.  My beef with this arrangement is that there is no adjustment on the amount of product that is sprayed.  It would be nice if some adjustment mechanism was provided.  Second, i that I accidentally sprayed a little on the end of a Boxwood hedge and it almost immediately (as in the next day) turned some of the leaves brown.  It did not occur to me that it would consider Boxwood to be a weed.  My fault, but a warning on the label would be nice.  As with all weed killers, though, it did not cover near as much area as it claimed, that being 5,000 sq fr.  I got probably 1,500 square feet from 2 bottles.  If there was an adjustment on the bottle, I could have varied it, of course.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

The only reason I knocked it down to a four-star rating is because the directions are extremely hard to find and in such small print that a 60-year-old person like me might have trouble reading them.With that said, what has worked for me is:1) Apply the chemical when the weeds are not cut. Do not mow just before application. Let them leaf out.2) Wait at least an hour after application before watering but preferably wait 24-hours to let the product completely dry.3) Don't mow for at least 48-hours after application.You do these three things and it should work for you too.

Now, let me tell you about my thrilling adventure with a certain weed killer that has left me scratching my head.I stumbled upon this product that seemed to be the holy grail of weed annihilation - the Ortho WeedClear Lawn Weed Killer Concentrate. Intrigued and hopeful, I eagerly followed the instructions with the precision of a bomb defusal expert. I mean, who wouldn't want a pristine, weed-free lawn, right?But oh boy, reality hit harder than a brick to the face. I unleashed the Ortho WeedClear on my unsuspecting weeds, not once, not twice, but multiple times. And you know what? The weeds stood there, defiant, like they were auditioning for a role in a botanical action movie. I'm starting to think the people who wrote those glowing reviews were either high on some mystical herb or had a garden of plastic plants.I've dabbled in the dark arts of weed-killing before, and let me tell you, this Ortho concoction is like bringing a water gun to a flamethrower fight. While other weed killers flex their muscles and obliterate those pesky invaders within days, Ortho WeedClear just sat there twiddling its thumbs. It's been over a week, and I'm still waiting for the magical moment when my lawn transforms into a weed-free utopia. Spoiler alert: It hasn't happened.I can't help but feel like I've been bamboozled by a snake oil salesman in gardening gloves. Maybe there's some secret ingredient missing from the formula, like unicorn tears or the essence of a vengeful gardener's spirit. Who knows?In conclusion, if you're looking for a weed killer that's more effective than a sternly worded letter to your lawn, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. Ortho WeedClear might be the hero in someone else's garden, but in mine, it's just a silent spectator in the ongoing battle against the green invaders.

As usual, there were tons of weeds, I don't know the names of them, especially where I had planted new grass seed last fall.  I mixed with water as directed and sprayed my entire lawn making sure the leaves were covered.  This is a contact killer, not something that works through the soil.

herbs,Chimique,B004ZKABIW,Brian Moon,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2023","Context: You could lose yourself in trying to find ""the best"" weed killer. My dad stumbled onto this stuff a few years ago. He always had a ""custom"" mixture. It's a learning curve to find the right mixture. Read below:Pros:- Product is effective at killing everything, most of the time, besides the grass. Spray all over, and you're grass will be fine.- Price- Different volumes available for your yard size.Cons:- Experimenting: reading the manual wasn't only overly-complicated, but the recommended amount was far, far too weak. I calculated things multiple times based on yard size and recommendations in the manual. For this chemical to effectively kill clover, or anything other than thistle, I found that I had to increase the potency by a factor of nearly 2. I ramped it up over 3 separate uses and finally got to a lethal dose.- Not sure it's a con exactly, but to make this stuff is much more effective when adding three drops of Dawn Dish Soap. It visually appears to thicken up the solution a bit more to stick to the leaves on the clover, thistle, and whatever else you're trying to burn up.Overall:If I were to buy again, I'd get a the largest volume available seeing as I'm going to use more than I expected.

herbs,Chimique,B004ZKABIW,Bay Area Parent,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2020","I still give this 5 stars despite the sprayer. The herbicide seems to be effective. I sprayed my lawn with it, and while it didn't kill all the weeds, it knocked out most of them. Before I started, my yard and my neighbors were covered in common mallow and other broad leaf weeds. After about 6 weeks the weeds are coming back, but nowhere near like before. There is a visible line between my yard and my neighbors now where his yard is still mostly common mallow and mine is mostly grass.I am trying a second spraying even though it is now late Spring. Hopefully that will help. If I still have weeds in the fall, I will spray then, which is when you are really supposed to apply this stuff. My main problem with this was the sprayer. I couldn't tell if it was spraying. The level inside the bottle didn't seem to go down. I sprayed the yard for a VERY LONG time and it dropped down finally to about 3 ounces left. That was the first spraying. So this week I decided to put the last three ounces on the lawn. I sprayed the yard thoroughly ... twice. When I finished, the fluid in the level had dropped from 3 ounces to almost 6 ounces. Yes. That is right. IT WENT UP. So something was wrong with the dispenser. I have a big year so originally had two bottles. I had the same problem with both bottles.So, if you have a dispenser already, I recommend buying the herbicide separately and using your own sprayer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Chimique,B004ZKABIW,Repro63,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2017","Update 6/5/22: I have almost given up on this, but I figured out how to use it most effectively. Wait until the weeds, and in my case the Creeping Charly ground ivy is at its peak in the season. When the weeds are really at their peak, use this and be sure the wait 3 days after cutting your grass and leave it sit 2 days before cutting again. Give the grass a good soaking with it and let it do its work. Also read the instructions on temperatures. If it is too cold or too hot outside, this will not work correctly.After this application, I could see it working. It takes about three good days and you see the weeds and Creeping Charly start to die off. It takes about 2 weeks to see the effect. We now have grass. Here is my tip on the best way to use Weed Free Zone.Apply as I wrote above, but in late summer. That is very important. Then in fall re-seed your lawn with a good quality grass seed and fertilzer. Come spring, the weeds are gone, very thick grass takes over and my lawn now looks great. Repeat this process every year and you get a lawn that looks like you have a lawn care service doing it at a much lower cost. I am sticking with my issue on the sprayer. After spraying about 3/4 of the bottle, the Weed Free Zone get thick and milky, clogs the sprayer and doesn't work right anymore.I bought two more bottles for this coming fall to keep the weeds at bay. I will re-seed again and enjoy a great looking lawn next year again. I feel embarrased about the 1 star rating earlier due to my misuse of the product. Read, do it right, and it works wonders. 4 stars from us now. I took one star off for the clogging of the sprayer.Original review: didn't work as I expected. The sprayer doesn't work at all.

If I remember correctly, some said we should be doing this in the fall and not spring.  Well, I am not going to wait and let this creeping charlie expand even more than it is now.Got the bottle and went out that day to start applying it. (March 3, 2015)  We have a very large yard and I can't tell you how much creeping charlie is all over it.  Since we just moved in last July, I really didn't have a chance to scope out the grass.  Grass turned brown over the winter and with spring here I started noticing green splotches of creeping charlie.  I know how tough this stuff is to get control of so I wanted to get on it right away.First day we only sprayed about 1/2 of the back yard.  Sure enough it rained the next day!  Went out today to start again when I noticed all that I sprayed 5 days earlier was either wilted or completely dead.  I am more than thrilled!  Thought for sure the rain ruined the application effectiveness.It's hard to walk over an acre of grass and see every single bit of the creeping charlie.  But got as much as we could with this spray today.Now we will just have to wait a week and see if we got the majority of this stubborn weed.

herbs,Chimique,B004ZKABIW,Heather G,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2012",I live in Oklahoma and had a terrible weed problem. All my neighbors were paying upwards of 150 bucks to have the local landscape guy spray. I was advised to get this at our local nursery but you didn't get much for the price. So I bought one bottle. It began to work after 1 treatment. I only had enough to do my front yard and began to see it really work. I ordered this larger bottle online as I got twice the amount for the same price as the local nursery. I treated my front and back yard and it worked wonders. My front yard was so bad that a 2nd application killed off any pesky weeds that didn't die the first round. Now my lawn is just as beautiful as my neighbors and I didn't spend nearly an 1/8th of what they did! I HIGHLY recommend this stuff.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

So, I have a challenge each year with keeping the unwanted grass and weeds out of my lawn.The Preen Crabgrass Control is a preventive treatment.  That is, you apply it prior to seeing any crabgrass in your lawn.  It is designed to keep it from even getting a start.First, a disclaimer.  It is not possible to prove a negative – that is, you can observe that there is no crabgrass but you cannot prove why.  Since I treated my yard, it is not possible to say how bad things might have been.  I did not split test my lawn.I have not seen any evidence of crabgrass in the lawn this year.  It apparently is doing what it is designed to do.I use a spreader and set it according to the instruction on the package.

That’s saves us a lot of muscle power in the future. Plus, application is easy and fast.Considering, though, that we own one acre of land, it is expensive to keep our lawn looking pretty. In essence, we require 10 bags of Preen Lawn Crabgrass Control, because one bag covers 5,000 square feet, and we need a total of nearly 50,000 square feet of this product to cover our entire lawn.That being said, for us a nice-looking environment is worth the cost and effort, and this product will help us keep up appearances.Thank you for taking the time to read my review, and if you find it Helpful, please click the “Helpful” button below.

It’s pretty hard to find crabgrass control that is not mixed with something else, so I appreciate this product.(2) Although this is a pre-emergent crabgrass killer (which means its a preventer that stops crabgrass from germinating before you see it in your lawn—apply it late winter/early spring before it gets warm enough for last year’s seeds to germinate which is around 50-55 degrees), it also works if you are a little late in spring because it also works on EARLY post-emergent crabgrass (that means if you start to see some in your lawn early in the spring, this will still work to kill that early crabgrass too).This is not the product to apply in June after your crabgrass is well established.  For that you would need a post-emergent crabgrass killer.This is a good product for preventing crabgrass and controlling it very early in spring. I do recommend it.If my review was helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking “helpful”.  Thanks.",5.0 out of 5 stars,

It has kept crabgrass from taking hold, but I couldn't really comment on killing any active spots.  Also, while it seemed to indicate that it would control or even kill other types of weeds, I haven't seen much in that regard.  I don't have new weeds, but the existing ones are still there.  I do like that when it says it treats 5,000 square feet, that's at the full strength needed to both prevent and kill.  A lot of products label themselves for 5,000 square feet, but then when you read the application guidelines, it only covers that much at the very minimum coverage guideline.  This was the opposite scenario where you can apply at the higher rate and still have enough product for 5,000 square feet.",5.0 out of 5 stars,

Meyer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2016","So I just spoke to a rep at Bayer over the phone who was clearly reading the ""My fault"" responses that popped up on her screen. They are offering me a refund of 8 dollars because I,in their words, over broadcast their ""safe for St Augustine"" weed killer hose spray.The problem here is ""Over-broadcasting""...... If you buy and use this product there is no way that you cannot over broadcast this. You hook up the hose and half the bottle dumps out in 3 minutes. Do the math-You would have to be spraying this over 16,000 sq. ft and literally running around your property at a very fast pace. This idea is ridiculous. Even more ridiculous is the bottle misleads you by stating "" treats up to 16,000 sqft"" Up to? Well they really hold the belief that it should be all 16,000 sqft.! if you use this on 15,500 sqft you just misused their product, your fault! ... I simply sprayed this over a large lawn area with no overlapping involved and because there is no regulation of the flow rate from the bottle, NONE! It jets out and empties the bottle very quickly.... ""in the eyes of Bayer"" I have misused their wonderful safe for St.Augustine product. I was told several times to ""always read the directions"" as if I am some idiot who just got into lawn care. Bayer should have stepped up and admitted their defective delivery system.Most importantly I followed all directions- 4 days of low temps, Regular St Augustine (not Floratam) , no overlapping areas etc. and now over 60% of my previously healthy lawn is dead. This will also happen to you if you use this- make sure you read other reviews from around the web. This is a very poor product and it will kill your lawn and there is nothing that Bayer will do for you except make you feel at fault and condescendingly refund the 8 bucks that killed your healthy grass.Yeah thanks alot for the offer but what about my lawn?Now I am left with a decision on either to re-sod or try to somehow save the little remaining grass I have left. Please be advised that Bayer will not do anything for you, they take no responsibility and systematically set you up with a series of questions to find a fault so they are not left liable. you are much better off mixing and using your own sprayer to treat your lawn or paying a service to do it for you. From here out I will never buy another Bayer product not even an aspirin. This product should be removed from the shelves and a recall/class action suit should follow. I cannot express to those of you sitting in the store holding this product in your hand and considering the purchase, hopefully you are reading the reviews that I failed to read before I used this blue bottle of poison.

herbs,Chimique,B0716CTFNG,Chris,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2018","OK...I've used this twice now and it works well.  The first time I used this it did not work at all, that was totally my fault.  At the top of this bottle is a trigger that you need to push forward, when you do water streams out.  What I didn't realize is that the first detent is water only.  When you push it farther forward then it sucks the weed killer up.  So I have proven now that water does not kill weeds.  Once I did this correctly, the Chickweed was turning color by the next morning.  Now I've read that some people really soak the area.  I wouldn't and that's not what the instructions say.  This kills by landing on the leaves and soaking in.  It doesn't go up through the root system.  It doesn't kill the grass...but it is hard on it.  That's why I'd be careful as to how much you lay down on your healthy grass.  Kill the weed not the lawn.  I've included a picture of 3 days after I applied this. The top corner is new SOD. The poison did touch that aread and you can see it's ok. I didn't soak it, but it got sprayed.  It's dying everywhere on my lawn.  I'm guessing after it's done I'll overseed and fertilize to get things back to normal.  But my guess to the reviews that say this doesn't work, they probably didn't push the trigger fully forward.  Because I don't see how I could have 100% success and then someone else would have none.  This was very quick acting once I sorted the trigger out.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Chimique,B0716CTFNG,Bradley.s.Philipson,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2018","I never liked Ortho products as i bought multiple weed killers before from them and they never worked.I then was always against using their products and stuck to other weed products. Well i had an infestation of wild violet and clover covering my septic mound in the back of my yard. I used multiple products and nothing seemed to get rid of the problem. I've saw multiple Youtubers using this product claiming it got rid of wild violet and thought why not and try their products again. My first purchase was from my local store and i ended up spraying it down at night a couple months ago. I came back the next day to find the leaves were starting to slowly die and it seemed to be doing it's job. fast forward a week and it killed most of my wild violet along with burning small parts of my lawn which it claims it doesn't. I sprayed this product under 80 degrees so i didn't understand but it was no big deal for me. I would say that Ortho B gon got rid of about 85-90% of the wild violet and clover on my septic mound with the first spray. I waited 2 months and then today 8/10/18 i applied it again to finally get rid of the rest. It seemed to be the same product you can buy from a local hardware store, but the handle was different but i mean if it gets the job done then who cares. WRONG. I connected the hose, turned the water on and it started leaking from the connection. I tightened it a bit more and it stopped leaking for a bit. Well as i moved around my yard spraying, every time the hose moved at the connection it started leaking. Now don't get me wrong the product works wonders but this stuff was leaking all over me the entire time. Now i was applying this product heavily to the spots with wild violet so i didn't mind if it leaked, but if you need an exact amount then i wouldn't recommend this over just buying it locally. I knew it was leaking the product along with the water because you could smell it. I'm not sure if it was just this bottle that was leaking or if they all do that. Besides the leaking i would highly recommend this product  to kill the violet and clover.

I expected it to be similar to Roundup which kills quickly, but this is more of an ‘endurance’ product.I finally got on the website and looked up reviews on what people found worked best (or what they experienced). Yes, it took two courses of spray every two weeks to eradicate the oxalis. I made sure I watered the night before and made sure I hadn’t mowed three days prior to application (or three days after).

herbs,Chimique,B0716CTFNG,F. Miscione,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2023","I have a terrible creeping Charlie problem, which I have treated before.  This year I went to war.  So here is my experience with this product.  I like this concentrate in the container so you can mix your own ratios and spray with the sprayer of your choice or swab unlike the hose sprayer containers at the big box store.  If you follow the instructions, I believe mine said 3-6ounces per gallon of water to treat yada yada 1-2000 sq ft. It will weaken the creeping charlie and in some cases kill it, good thing being it will not hurt your grass. (Best going into fall)  Ok some control, but I want it gone!  I tried about 9 ounces of product with 1/2 gallon.  Worked better, but it will kill grass at this level.  If you have an accurate tip for your sprayer you can mitigate the damage to your lawn.  Swabbing full strength works best, everything you coat will die (I used a 1"" paint Brush).  Very tedious and time consuming to swab especially depending on how much you have and the size of your yard.  At least with the concentrate I can do that.  In retrospect, I should have used some kind of dye in my sprayer because I was dealing with a large area and even though I was methodical in my application, there were some areas I missed.  So if it is your first time with this product and you have a large area to treat, you could start with the recommended label instructions, just be prepared that you may have to retreat after a week or two.  They will usually turn yellow, crinkle and die in 2-5 days.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Chimique,B0716CTFNG,An observer,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2021","This worked great for me (northeast US)!  My yard had been taken over by large patches of thick white CLOVER.  I tried pulling it out.  I saw I wasn't going to be able to do it.  Then I remembered something in a green bottle that I used about 15 years ago, and sure enough it was an Ortho product specifically for CLOVER.  So I ordered this one and sprayed it only on the patches of clover back on April 5 and watched it to see.  I was skeptical.  It just looked like water on the clover plants.  But six days later the clover was turning yellow.  So, two weeks after the first application I sprayed it again, just to make sure the product was zapping it.  Gradually, the clover not only turned yellow but also shriveled up among the remaining grass.  And now, six weeks after the initial application, I can't see ANY TRACE of the clover that I sprayed.  No trace whatsoever.  But several small patches of clover have popped up in nearby areas that I didn't spray, so I sprayed those today.  So, THE PRODUCT WORKS.  It's not instant gratification, though.  It does take awhile.  Now here is the one thing YOU NEED TO KNOW.  When clover grows in your grass, it crowds out the grass so that there's less grass that can grow there.  And when the clover is removed, well, there's less grass there.  I think this is why some people are saying it killed their grass.  It was the CLOVER that crowded out the grass.  The spray does not kill grass.  The remedy for thin grass or small bare spots where the clover crowded out the grass is to spot treat the areas and plant more grass seed.  If the spots are small enough, the existing grass will grow into it, now that the clover is gone.  I'm really glad I bought this and was able to get rid of the large patches of clover!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I've applied one treatment, and about 80-90 percent of them showed significant symptoms of dying.  It took at least a week before they really looked like they were going down, and almost 3 weeks before I was able to say that 80-90% are gone.  I will hit the remaining ones again in another week or so.  My main concern now is what will happen next spring.  I fear there may be a nonoccurence.

herbs,Chimique,B0716CTFNG,Bob Weaver,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2023","This product will NOT kill clover.  It barely does damage to Violets with a single application (spot spray).  This product wouldn't kill anything if applied as a blanket spray of the lawn and at intervals per labeling.The clover's waxy leaves don't allow for even coverage on the leaves, as required for a product like this to work.  Even adding an additional surfactant to the mix, e.g. baby shampoo (thanks Allyn the Lawn Care Nut on YT) Doesn't help to relieve the surface tension on the clover leaf.It has one of two ingredients that are effective on the labeled weeds, so it should get some results better than what it is done.  Perhaps the formula is too weak.  However, even mixing the product at a higher rate than labeled, should do more damage to the weeds than it does, so I'm not sure what the problem is in total.It works fine on Chickweed but that's an easy one to kill anyway.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I tried everything that the local Home Depot had - no luck - and everything that sounded plausible from the gardening sites on the Internet.  Finally came to this product(not at the local Home Depot??  Wonder why) and called the 800 number to see if it would let my Korean grass live and kill the oxalis....they said it was one of the specific grasses that this worked on.  I tried the strength that they recommend in a garden hand sprayer and it didn't really do much, but I read on some of the other reviews that you should double the strength.  You have to make sure that you don't water for a couple of days after spraying, but once I doubled the strength it killed 90% of the oxalis in a few days.  Shriveled up and I didn't even have to pull up the dead stuff.  I am absolutely dead amazed at how well this worked, and on the second application the oxalis was gone for good - just don't get this on your other plants or it will kill them, so be careful.

In that you have a nice lawn being invaded by clovers or that dreaded Oxalis weed.  And you're probably wondering the same two things....  First, does it work and second, will it kill my grass.  Well, from my observations, the answer to the first question is yes, but for Oxalis, it may take a couple treatments.  I noticed that it has definitely affected the Oxalis, but because it's such an evasive, strong weed, it's leaves turned brown but the roots seem like they're still unaffected.  I'm hoping its early yet and the leaves are an early sign that it will eventually die.  But for sure, this particular variant of Scott's Weed-B-Gone has been formulated to systemically affect Oxalis.  I'll try to remember to update this review at a layer point in time, but even though my Oxalis doesn't appear to be ""dead-dead"", I'm satisfied that I found something that addresses it.As for the regular grass...  Well....  Good news!  So far at least, my regular grass seems unaffected.  And it remains so after a good drenching of Weed-B-Gone with a garden hose attachable sprayer.  So this made me even more pleased.The product seems to work as advertised, and even if it takes awhile to kill the Oxalis (or simply halts it's advancement) I'm happy.

Herbicides normally ask for 1/3 of an ounce surfactant per gallon of water, and although this bottle will last a long time at that rate, consider that you are likely need multiple applications.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

herbs,Chimique,B004XDHRCE,Mark Twain,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2017","Summary:It’s cheap, lasts a long time, kills weeds faster, and helps use less chemicals / repeat sprays.After entensive use I’ve figured this out. It’s amazing and don’t spray without it. Makes weed killer about 10% more effective. What? Only 10% you say... At the same time, it makes the weed killer work 2x to 3x as fast. By day 3, I can see the weed killer work almost everytime. Normally, it takes 7-10 days before I can see results. In a fast world, this is a life saver. Helps knowing you’ve done right by your lawn. Guessing 7 days later if you have to spray again is not a game you want to be playing and not one your lawn wants to deal with.I would also definitely recommend using the insecticide rates even for herbicides or doubling the herbicide rate of 1-2tspn per gallon. I didnt notice any benefit at a 1-2 teaspoon rate per gallon. I might have a weird water hardness though.On a side note:Much smaller than expected. Not quite sure what I had envisioned a pint looking like. I should’ve gotten the gallon.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

As a result, I have to mix up various chemicals to kill specific types of weeds. I always add two things at the end of the herbicides to my sprayer - this surfactant and blue dye (Monterey sells MarkIt). The surfactant helps the herbicide stick, and NOT slide, to the leaves of the weeds. This is especially helpful when spraying large batches of poison ivy. Because it sticks, and because the final solution is blue (MarkIt), it is very easy to see where I have sprayed the herbicide mix.I have not run into any instances yet in which I would not use this product. Not much is needed to make your herbicide ""soapy"" and stick to the plants. While you could use dish soap, it tends to form bubbles in the sprayer tank when you slosh it (to stir up the chemicals) around. I have found this to work much better. You can certainly use dish soap in a pinch.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

(if you do have any type of pine tree/ bush and have bagworms ugly black worms that turn into white moths, and eat the pine needles, or bush leaves, get bifiden) my problem was a fungus that makes  the needles fall off and from growing again called needlecast.  i have many pine trees and 3 were really bad 1 almost gone,  trying to save it.  after one dousing good application and fertilizer stakes to encourage new growth,  several that has some of this are like new.  2 of the 3 which were really bad are almost there, and 1 which was almost dead with no needles, I am trying to bring back.  the bad and kinda bad ones i did 2 applications so far  2 weeks apart, bc it rained a lot.  but this stuff kills the fungus and the needles come back.  it makes enough for me to use it for 5 years this little container.WORD TO THE WISE. after you mix this with water, only a couple oz are needed per gallon, use the mix, if you let it sit it gets ugly stick black,  use it and rinse the container out.dont spray near a white fence, will turn black.clean up any that spills when you mix right away and no problem.  its really dark blue.thought it would be green. was surprised.I am going to spray the really bad trees every 2 weeks until like new, and the ones with a little bit just april, june, and sept.also for really good growth and vibrant pines, put the fertilizer stakes in april after ground isnt frozen, and in sept.  i didnt fertilize them in sept. before but now i do.  much better looking trees.if you happen to smell it in the wind, you get a faint catpiss scent.  very faint.  dont spray too close to your house it can stain the siding, shingles, paint, or dont do it on windy day.

And it's natural, so you can use it on crops without worrying about tainting your veggies or accidentally poisoning small critters.My only issue with it is this: why doesn't it come with a small measuring cup or eye dropper?  You have to dilute this stuff (it's in industrial strength concentration) and it's hard to measure without some kind of small measuring device and you most certainly do not want to use your kitchen stuff on this.  Farmers and serious growers aren't going to buy the 8oz version, they go larger.  This size is for the weekend warrior, and weekend warriors don't have $1.5k+ spray machines that auto dilutes the mixture.

nematodes,Chimique,B002Y6DNCK,Cat Lady,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2012","We have been using Ortho home bug spray for several years now in order to keep a roach, scorpion & spider problem under control. We  hadn't really seen many roaches inside our house, except an annoying few during the night in our kitchen. The real problem was out in our back yard & back part of the house where there are prominent cracks in the foundation (old house) & less traffic. In the yard we have flies as well that we could not get rid of easily on our garbage cans (I tried insect spray, but once it gets wet from rain or the sprinklers outside it stops working).Well, I had read about Demon WP online searching for a way to get rid of Black Widow spiders & many people reviewed this product to kill many different bugs right on contact including black widows. Thankfully Amazon has it here because it isn't available in my town.The first spraying I just did a few choice spots to see if it would really work ( I was skeptical). I used 2 packets in a one gallon sprayer. The next morning we found a couple dozen bugs inside the back part of our house & the outside area were where the masses were dead.  Impressive.  So, I mixed up just one packet in a gallon sprayer & went around the inside & outside again focusing on all the cracks, perimeter & missing nothing.  The next morning we found more bugs than the first time. Now it has been a week since my initial spraying & we are still finding dead bugs, roaches, beetles, ants, spiders, moths & flies to name a few.Now I had the idea to spray our rental home that is semi vacant. There was a take over by black widow spiders in that house. It took one packet in a one gallon sprayer, full inside perimeter & just the area outside where the spiders were taking over, including the front porch perimeter. Next morning & every other morning after that we continue to find dozens of bugs dead before they made it into the front door, including the black widow spiders. That cleared up the bug problem.I had no idea this stuff would continue to work as well as it is. In the past we have tried sprays, powders & mixes that bugs became immune to or that quit working once it got wet from rain or the sprinklers. Demon WP does not stop killing bugs & when I say it kills bugs, I do mean it kills in masses if that's what you have crawling around your house like we did.I've re-ordered this larger pack, because the price to mix my own comes out less than buying a gallon of already mixed spray (that doesn't work as well). My plans now are to share this with my family who are having a serious bug problem & live in an old, cracked house with many places for bugs to hide. I would not recommend this to my family if it did not work. This stuff works better than any store bought product I have tried in many, many years & for the first time we do not have bugs in our patio, porch, or even the back parts of our house. We can sit outside & not be attacked by a crawly thing.Amazing feeling to know that one simple powder mix can & does eliminate a bug problem quickly as it does. Keep in mind that if you have a really bad problem with bugs, you will need to spray occasionally to keep the numbers down. I am going to continue spraying as well, too.One comment on the odor, this to me has no odor & does not burn my skin if I spill it on me. (be careful to wear gloves & keep away from your face though).Great product, excellent price & like the reviews state this stuff works.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

nematodes,Chimique,B002Y6DNCK,Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2012","I moved to the desert early 2011 and within the first year had to call exterminators from 4 different companies. We had black widows the size of my thumb all around the house, hobos that sent me running, and ironically ended up with brown widows, wolf spiders and flying ants after months of treatments along with these little black beetles. It got to the point that we kept rubber mallets in the kitchen, bedrooms and bathrooms. I was told the infestation (the house had been vacant for over 2 years before we moved in) was so bad I had no choice but to tent it which I couldn't afford. Luckily no one has suffered a bite, so I started researching and found Demon WP reviews online and figured the $20 was worth the try before going in debt to finance tenting the house or medical bills.The first time we did it was in the garage to see if it even worked. We soaked the entire garage, which is unfinished with rafters exposed, along the floor line, ceiling connections and back and forth along the walls. The next day we were sweeping them off the floor so we did it again and had more the following day! The one place I didn't do, which is where they ran, was to all of the nooks in the rolling garage door so don't forget that. That weekend we did the perimeter of the house, around every window and door along with the perimeter of the yard. All I can say is that the desert has WAS too many bugs.I was concerned about spraying inside the house because I have dogs and cats so I called the manufacturer. They said once it dries its no longer toxic to them so I took everyone to the groomer for a few hours of pampering and came home to do the job. All rooms along the floor boards, around outlets, along windows and ceiling lines and inside all closets and cupboards (I was OK with running everything through the dishwasher over the next few days). I spent hundreds on exterminators in our first year here but then spent probably around $50 on this. We saturated the house (inside and out) and fence line the first few weeks then marked our calendar and do it the first weekend every three months and we have only seen 3-4 spiders in the last 6 months!The only thing better than this for the aggressive and toxic spiders is a hammer!UPDATE: I used this specifically for the toxic spider problem as mentioned above. I gave an envelope (4 pk) to a friend who has seen her spider problem multiply the last few years who said it didn't work for her after she did ""all 4 treatments"" this fall. After the first trial treatment I did the house and garage with 3 packets to a 2 gl sprayer then resprayed later with 2 packets to 2 gallons, she used 1 packet to 2 gallons of water four different times with little/no result.Even though its winter my son went over this last weekend and sprayed a heavier dose (3pk/2gl)in her garage where she still sees a few, the next morning she found 6 curled up on the floor dead so, I may be wrong and you can call the manufacturer, but a heavier dose may be needed for the more poisonous spiders. Last year we spent the winter with every bug in creation searching out a warm spot, this winter we haven't seen a single bug in the house or in the garage.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Brose,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2022","Rule #1: Don't be a moron and spray ANY hazardous chemical solutions where your pets may come into contact with those chemicals. After moving into a house with a basement during the middle of winter (February) we were noticing quite a few bugs coming in to the 1st floor rooms. I don't blame them for wanting to get away from the snow & ice outside, but not into my house. So I used Demon WP downstairs around the entire perimeter of the basement at the top of all the walls, and at the top & bottom of the interior bearing walls. BAM! No more problem with bugs upstairs. For the next 9 months I had to walk around the basement once a month with a dust buster to vacuum up any dead bugs from the floor. I finally saw our first spider web after the initial treatment, so I sprayed the basement a second time in October. During that second 9 month period I rarely saw any dead bugs in the basement, and just the occasional stink bug upstairs that probably came in through an open window. I just did a 3rd treatment of Demon WP one month ago in July and so far over the past month I have only seen one dead bug in the basement, so it does appear to me that Demon WP creates a very effective barrier against bugs entering our basement, and when an insect does happen to breech the bug blockade, within a few steps of entering our basement the bug dies. So besides being a very effective insecticide, the protective barrier of Demon WP just goes on and on and on just like the Energizer bunny. I used two packets of Demon WP in two gallons of water to fully saturate and treat our 1500 square feet basement.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

nematodes,Chimique,B002Y6DNCK,K.G.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2019","We've had a millipede infestation this summer in our house. First it was in the kitchen when the Dallas area was getting lots of rain this spring. We've lived in this house since 2003 and NEVER had I experienced this kind of crawly bug infestation. Once the rains stopped, they slowly disappeared out of our kitchen. At least the crunching under my shoes stopped.But then they started appearing in our bedroom. And since our floors are very dark wood, they were difficult to see. But not in our bathroom that has beige tile! I couldn't figure out where in the world they were coming in at. Talked to a pest control company and they said since we lived on the edge of the woods they were coming in around the windows. But they weren't. Because of pets in our home, I tried diatomaceous earth since it's safe around pets, but the powder was terrible to work with. And it didn't really kill the buggers like I'd hoped.So before I called in the pest control company, I thought I'd try this. I knew it was not going to be something I could let my pets get around, so we kept them out of our bedroom. I vacuumed and steam cleaned our bedroom and bathroom floors (no carpet, just hardwood and tile) thinking I'd start fresh with this poison that says it kills millipedes.Well, I finally saw where they were coming in at......from around my toilet and any crack at my baseboards in the bathroom. OMG!!!  So after spraying this in ever crack and crevice I could find, I would see these crawly bugs coming up. But they would soon die. Curled up in a little circled and they DIED!! I had to spray heavy doses for several days and nights to finally get them to even slow down in coming in through the cracks that of course formed as our house settles each season. But this was the only thing that I tried that finally REALLY WORKED! And the pest control company swore they had to be coming in under my doors and windows.

nematodes,Chimique,B002Y6DNCK,ep,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2015","You cannot go wrong with this! We don't have roaches and some say this doesn't work on those (even the Demon website says they have something specific for that) what we DO have is black widows, brown recluse and big biting ants that break through the asphalt up and down the street! When we moved in 4.5 years ago the house (in the desert) had been vacant for around 3 years and the spiders had taken hold. Seven exterminators over the first year and nothing helped. I spent 100's of dollars and was told at every turn that I needed to have the house tented plus monthly maintenance which was too costly for what they said would be a never ending battle. I first tried this after sending a desperate message to the makers asking for help and will never not use it.This will drop these mothers like no ones business but it is HIGHLY toxic to anything it come in contact with until it dries (per the manufacturer) so I notify my neighbors when we spray the perimeter of the house and yard so they can keep their dogs in for a few hours. I spray inside the house and attic once a year on the day I take my dogs in for shots and grooming then air it out to protect them. If you have any questions contact the makers, they are very helpful! My adult son does the sprays and to be safe he keeps old shoes just for this, undresses int he garage, throws everything he has on directly into the washer and runs into the shower wrapped in a towel. I wouldn't recommend spraying on a windy day.As far as maintenance we spray the perimeter of the house along the ground, along the roof line, around all windows and doors (be sure to put towels down if you have kids or animals inside) in the late winter/early spring, once the heat reaches around 100 deg then again when it cools off for the season. If we see those damn biting ants in the yard or even in the street we mix up a batch, find their opening and spray directly down their tubes sending them somewhere else.That first year we literally had ""spider mallets"" (rubber mallets) in every room because nothing worked. Now we might see 10-20 a year. I'll also add that some people in my area have started complaining of scorpions even as close as the house across the street but I haven't seen a single one here!The seller was super quick, I received the shipment within days of ordering. You will need a 2 gallon pump sprayer which is very cheap compared to an exterminator.I hope this helps.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

nematodes,Chimique,B002Y6DNCK,Placeholder,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2012","If you are still buying your pest control products at a regular store, you are wasting a lot of money. So did I before I started deeply researching the pest problem. The building were I used to live was flooded with roaches and no matter how I tried I carried some of them into my new clean apartment. Seven months later, my new apartment was infested again., even though I called pest control twice. Also wasted money. Enter Demon WP. This stuff is potent, however you have to give it time to really work and this product will NOT eliminate the entire infestation. I call it a butcher's axe. If you look at it like that, this product is amazing. Taking into consideration that my infestation was pretty bad, it axed about 95% of it within 2 weeks. I was amazed myself how many of them dropped dead, i had to swipe them off every day. This product is a good starting point. I realized that in order to completely get rid of these nasty creatures, you have to use Demon in conjunction with other products. Residual sprays only kill roaches that walk across their residue, and eventually there will be survivors even if you spray everywhere, because most of them hide in cracks and can sit there and wait for up to 2 weeks. Roaches reproduce very fast, so you also need baits, so they can carry the poison into their harborage sites, where the rest is hiding. I placed DuPont Advion baits and Gentrol stations ( this product controls insects growth, so they can't reproduce) 3 weeks after I sprayed with Demon, so I could fully control their population. Dont use Demon together with baits, wait until it starts wearing off a bit, otherwise it will repel roaches from eating baits. So far so good. I am not completely roach free, since there is no miracle product, but I am relived, I only see a couple of them sometimes, less and less everyday. I will continue placing fresh baits and update in 3 months.NOTE: I used a stronger concentration - 2 pouches for 1 gallon.

nematodes,Chimique,B002Y6DNCK,Am That I Am,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2013","We live next to the woods.  There are ants.  They try to get in the house every spring; it's just something to deal with.Once I hired an exterminator.  They spray everywhere with tons of spray and never really solved the problem.  So I researched it myself and figured out how to deal with it every year using a fraction of the chemicals.First, use bait WITHOUT spray outside to poison ants and their colonies.  You can make your own bait super cheap with Borax.  Just google ""Borax Ant Bait Recipe"" and find recipes on the internet.  Borax is safe enough to wash your close in.I then use Demon in a sprayer.  I USE A DEDICATED SPRAYER.  If there's any scent on the spray, the ants will avoid it.  I then spray inside in just certain specific spots where I know the ants get in.  I use maybe 1/50th the amount of spray the professional exterminated did.Demon WP being unscented is an excellent blocking spray but it won't wipe out a colony as the ants die to quick and don't bring the poison back to the nest.It takes a few weeks to get them blocked but ever year I nip the problem without an expensive professional exterminator with less chemicals.If you do go to one of the two nationally-advertised exterminator companies (you know who they are), they will want to come quarterly in order to warranty their work.  That means $100-200 several times a year and lots a spraying of lots of chemicals.  Ask yourself, if you are paying someone every three months to fix your problem, do they have an incentive NEVER to fix the problem all the way.If you can do research and read labels carefully, you can do a better job cheaper yourself.

On going to their web site they say you need to also use a bait to get them to take it back to the place they live.  This product will kill them when they come out and walk around.  The bait I used seemed new as it was a liquid.  It's called Hotshot Liquid Roach Bait.  I spread out the little canisters and waited for the Demon WP to arrive.  I could begin to see a decrease on roaches at night until the Demon arrived.When it arrived I mixed it as directed for initial treatment and sprayed it under the washer and dryer, refrigerator, stove and dish washer.  Also spayed it in all the holes where the drains for sinks and washing machine were located.  Also sprayed it around baseboards in bathrooms wherethey seemed to really like showing up.  Spayed baseboards in kitchen and around outside near doors and garage door.Roaches rapidly started decreasing at night.  In about three days after spraying Demon there were no more roaches I saw but did find a few bodies. After about a 5 days there were no more bodies and no live roaches.  I'm sold on this stuff.

nematodes,Chimique,B002Y6DNCK,Ruppert,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2015","Demon WP is incredible for killing insects.  This product was recommended to me by our last pest guy.  We live out of the city so spiders, crickets and scorpions are the norm.  I typically spray this 2-3 times a year both inside and out.  Our lower floor is all wood, which leads to the only downside to this product.  At the mixture I use, this does leave a splotchy white residue on the wood floors where sprayed.  Typically, by the time I'm spraying this product inside, the insects are enough of an issue that I don't mind.  So long as it does the job (and it certainly does the job), I'm fine with the residue for a couple of weeks before it gets mopped up.  Even with this downside, I've continued to use it and recommend it to friends.Another way around the issue would be to just spray in the hidden areas, where most of the little critters hide out anyway.  If I focused behind the chairs and chests, in the door jams, in the cracks and crevices, this would be much less of an issue and likely still just as effective.The packets are water soluble, so they just need to be dropped in your sprayer before you begin to fill it up with water, keeping you from having to touch the powder at any point.

It was enough solution to spray around the edge of the pool, the hottub stairs, around the entire base of the house, the courtyard, and inside the garage. We have stacked stone surface on most stuff in our backyard (pool, retaining wall, fire pit, pool equipment platform, etc.) so there are tons of little crevices for spiders to hide in.As for effectiveness - this stuff basically rains death. It's not instant - I saw some one-star reviews saying that they sprayed the spider and it just ran away. That happened to me too - especially with the larger ones (a few of those black widows were the size of a quarter). But I intentionally went out at night with a flashlight so they would be out in their webs and easy to spray. As long as you get them with a good dose, within 5 minutes they are dead. The ones that ran away crawled back out from their hiding spot within a minute or two as they were clearly heading toward the light.

Safer's says ""not for pesticidal use,"" but I tested it and it works just fine. I'm not going to worry about the labeling - as long as it's food-grade, this is safe for pets and people.This year we have a plague of fleas. I thought it was because SoCal had lots of rain, but people on social media are reporting it's bad all over. And the fleas seem to be on steroids this year.  I'm using Frontline every three weeks (vet approves this frequency) on our cats right now. Most warm seasons I use it once every six weeks. This helps the cats, but there are fleas and flea eggs on the floor and furniture. That's where regular sweeping, vacuuming, and diatomaceous earth come in.I put the DE in a shaker bottle or flour sifter and put it on area rugs and let it sift in between the fibers. The DE destroys insect exoskeletons. (It's fantastic for getting rid of ants safely, too.) I lightly sprinkle the furniture, leave it overnight and vacuum. I sprinkle it on hardwood and tile floors. On the cats' bedding. Basically everywhere. Sometimes, I even rub a bit onto the cats themselves - the ones who are flea magnets. I do this a few days after the Frontline goes on if they need it. Usually just treating where they sleep - furniture, cat beds, the bedspread of our bed - is enough.Vacuuming takes care of. You can also use it in the kitchen. I like to put it at the edges of counters and across doorways or wherever else ants think they should enter. You can also make a paste of it with a little water and smoosh it into openings that ants use to travel into the kitchen or bath.It won't get rid of all the insects, but it really, really helps. It's safe. But keep in mind that it's very dusty - it always is - so if you're using it heavily, use a mask and keep the pets away until the dust settles.One more great use: Sprinkle it on your rose bushes. It will stop ants from farming aphids on them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,

So, although an inadvertent oversight, this particular food grade product is working well as a pesticide.

You can add this to your feeds for those reasons as well as possibly helping with internal parasites in your animals. I think Safer doesn't market this specifically for pesticidal use as it doesn't have any other additives like some other varieties. It also could have been heat treated which renders it less effective for pesticidal use. Whatever the case I think they put that disclaimer on it so they don't have any claims as such. Rather it is intended for feed stocks. This variety also has use as a soil amendment. It in particular it is very popular for bonsai potting where it has been used as the sole potting medium.

Also has treated some indoor plant mite issues. It is messy as it is a fine powder and it doesnt work when wet but its worth clean up and re applying! Most pest control methods seem to only claim to be effective if regularly repeated and cleaned up after.When i first moved in to a new rental i wasnt aware that it would need to be flea bombed after 2 weeks to kill what wasnt killed the first time. Didn't bomb just sprinkled DE everywhere waited a few hrs vacuumed then sprinkled again and vaccumed+resprinkle daily for about a week before all the fleas were gone.

I was obviously having quite a time with these pests and just wanted something that would take them out without me having to do something every couple of hours to cut their populations but I also wanted it to be safe around me and my dog. After a lot of research, I settled on DA. I’ve had to “reapply” on certain plants because once watered, the DA does drift into the soil so there’s not always enough to combat insects around the rim of the pot, etc. However, to my understanding, it will keep working as long as it’s dry. Anyway, I’ve seen a significant decrease in fungus gnats, I’ve noticed less aphids and even springtails (even though I wasn’t focused on them). It has even managed to kill the aphids affecting one of my succulent props that I thought would die after seeing aphids literally coming out of it, however succulent is doing great and putting out new growth and doesn’t seem to have any aphids affecting it.

I mix it with distilled water (maybe that's overkill, but I have hard water) and it never leaves stains or residues on all the various surfaces I have sprayed it on. The type of bottle this comes in is the best -- it makes it just so easy to measure out and pour the needed amount. I actually bought a bunch of these bottles to use with other chemicals as well, but they are not cheap. So great value to get it already in this bottle!BUT the listing here is just incorrect or something. I mean, it says 176 gallons from this 32 fl oz bottle -- the standard mixture rate is 1 fl oz makes 1 gallon; doing the math that is... 32 gallons from this 32 fl oz bottle. I guess they are showing you use the minimum mixture rate there, so be aware.I use this product as a general home defense product. Applied at the typical 1 fl oz to 1 gallon rate, spread around the foundation 2 feet in each direction where the foundation and grade meet. Also 2 ft around every doorway and window, spray the eaves and soffit too. Don't forget your garage doors as well, as insects love to get in there. I don't use it indoors, because I don't want to unless absolutely needed, but I am starting to experiment with using it in the garage, as that is a sort-of outdoors location and there is all kinds of random spots bugs love to collect.When applying this way, and comparing to neighbors, it seems very effective. Don't have issues with insects like wasps under the eaves for example. I apply at least once a month, but when there is a lot of insect activity I do it every other week (instructions say you could do it as often as every week, but every other week seems effective enough to me). I try to apply when there will be no rain in 24 hours in each direction (before and after application) to make sure it doesn't get washed off.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Several corners of the house had this issue. I could not sick on deck, since wasps would buzz me, sometimes aggressively for no reason...I was 30+ feet away from end of house where they seemed to buzz around every day. Warm days, cold mornings...so I got up early and sprayed one really bad corner, soffit, corner vinyl trim piece, got all the cracks and crevices...while the bees slept in out of the cold. I was nervous spraying, expected a swarm. I would spray a second and run far away and observe. Braver and braver I sprayed more. That was one corner on day 1. It stayed cold all day, no wasps. The next day it warmed up, but I was never outside n deck. The day after I walked out and saw several wasps dead on the deck. Hooray! I sprayed again since I did see a few random wasps flying around. Then a day or two later I sprayed all the soffit areas, vinyl trim corners, gaps, holes, crevices, around crawl space to floor wall, in crawl space vents, any place I felt bugs or bees could intrude or live. Success. I occasionally see a yellow jacket or wasp, but no swarms on house or attacks on the deck. A European hornet buzzes by once in a while, but they nest out on the woods. So much happier now without wasps everywhere. Well worth the money and 1 gallon sprayer to treat this house. Also no more crickets in crawl space or inside house.

But beyond that, I have kids AND a cat. How could I ensure I wasn’t poisoning them?It took me a full month after ordering this product to work up the courage to try it, and it was SUPER easy to use. I ordered a sprayer too, and then you just mix however much the package says with one gallon of water in the sprayer.I sprayed all around the perimeter house, then I sprayed the perimeters of all the rooms inside. My house is 3,000+ sq ft, and one gallon was more than enough to spray both inside and outside.My kids and cat were completely unaffected. My cat even followed me around for most of the interior spraying, despite my best efforts to dissuade her (I should’ve locked her in a room; I’ll do that next time.)

The spiders and other nasties that crawl out of there are shocking and dangerous.This products toxicity is low for humans and animals, yet yields a high degree of toxicity for flying insects, arachnids and other creepy crawlies.One broad application on my eaves and ground perimeters, topped off with spraying the tops and sides of all bushes and trees, keeps our family and animals bug free for months and months.It seems to keep killing week after week because I find new carcasses months after applying.The amount of airborne insect traffic throughout the day into the evening has decreased dramatically. I believe that to be the result of spraying the tops and sides of all bushes and trees.I have recommended this product to my neighbors for them to try. Its effective for long term pest management and allows us to spend more time outside.This is not a ""bang your dead"" bug spray. Its systemic and persistent. It will ultimately kill the bugs in large numbers over long periods of time.

viruses,Chimique,B00ARKSABO,Neil Massey,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2013","Lowes doesn't carry this product. Home Depot does, but only online. Home Depot was also asking twice the price I found on Amazon, and with Prime, shipping was free, so the cost was even lower! One other significant difference between this brand and others is that this has 7.9% Bifenthrin, whereas other brands only have slightly over 2%. This is a concentrate, so it does pour out quite thick, but it easily dilutes in water in the sprayer. It's best if you mix the solution before you begin spraying. Just shake your bottle sprayer and you should be good to go.As for how the product worked, I found it to be excellent. I got this specifically to kill the Spittle bugs that were killing my lawn. After I figured out how many sq. ft. my lawn was, I only needed to mix 1 oz. per 1000 sq. ft. in a hose sprayer filled with water,  and I was good to go. It took me two days to do my lawn - I had to blow the leaves off first - completing the front and sides on the first day and the back yard the second day. I covered over 1/2 acre and still have plenty left over for a 2nd application.After spraying my front yard and sides, I went out the next morning and saw plenty of dead Spittle bugs lying in the grass, road and on my driveway. The second day went similarly in the back yard. Now, I'm starting to see my grass come back from the brink of dying due to a very wet Spring and Summer when Spittle bugs are very actively laying eggs and chomping my centipede and zoyzia grasses like there's no tomorrow!
